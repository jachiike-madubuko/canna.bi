       "'good hybrid high 👏 good taste good for anxiety and relaxation Purchased Wedding Cake at SunnySide Medical Cannabis Dispensary through their Mohawk Valley branch in New Hartford, New York. Excellent strain. Two hits into this I experienced a calm, relaxed state of being. Soothing head high. Feeling happy and talkative throughout, all while being mellow. Taste/aroma of vanilla and pepper. Smooth finish. Great for stress relief and anxiety. It’s an award winning strain for a reason. It’s pretty damn great. Highly recommend it. This is my go to strain! Easy to relax at home or be in public and socialize. Good one for being high through the day or morning. The flavor is good too. Well this is a unique strain that has nice flavor, relaxing and also stimulates the mind and made me feel \"good\" more than most of the new strains available today. The batch I got was grown outdoors and it was cheap so this wasn\\'t the best version of wedding cake to sample, but that\\'s my budget. Regardless, I was impressed by the interesting flavor, the boost to my mind, and the relaxation helped me sleep more than some other indicas. This is better than Slurricane and Purple Punch, as an example. Wedding Cake is a standout strain, highly recommended! :)\\n\\nAdded to my list favorite strains! Great strain for basically doing anything. love it My favorite strain. Awesome vanilla cake better taste and the aroma is awesome I wish the dispensaries would keep it In stock consistently It’s a good strain to relax and help me doze off to sleep at night. Definitely calming >> energetic. Didn’t help with social anxiety but helped me get out of my head during conversations so I could be emotionally present. its one of the stronger indicas I\\'d say. the one that really gets you off to sleep. Ohmylanta this was incredible. I cannot remember who grew this batch but both times my buds were frosted with trichromes. Like Frosted Flakes frosted. It was more than good, it was GRReeeaat!!! But for real I haven’t felt this his uplifted or euphoric since I had psilocybin. Highly recommend. Despite what people say it\\'s a very weak hitting strain. Tastes nice and smells good but doesn\\'t have really get me high just makes me and my friend\\'s overall uplifted feels like you have just been to the gym and finished a good workout - it\\'s that type of feeling THC level is amazing! Rolled a joint and only smoked a quarter of it, and let me tell you what. Phew. Amazing head high. Hard to hide the level of highness you feel when feeling such highness in front of those that are not high. Mind blown with that one! KA-Boom. Any ways, Wedding Cake, is a very good strain to help with loss of appetite (hardcore munchies), depression (giggly), and anxiety (witty). One of my faves in flavor for sure! The buds I’ve experienced were small, but dense. Very strong and pleasing aroma. My absolute favorite strain I\\'ve tried so far. This thing is a fantastic strain to relax and just vibe with. You can just feel the stress melt away. For me, my mind is usually extremely fuzzy, but in a good way. It also does stimulate arousal so... do what you will with that information. first time trying this strain:\\nhits hard , chill and giggly . a really nice cherry like flavor . amazing . literally the best . amazing sex too .  chill at work.\\n\\nsecond time buying: doesn’t make me hungry, makes me kinda trippy though and all confusion . paranoid a little at work when communication with other employees but definitely made me productive at the job I\\'m quite new to weed and this was suggested to me. While I did feel very calm and relaxed, I also was extremely dizzy and when I laid down had the spins terribly. I like this strain for when I get back from work or school or just had a long day in general. \\nIt creates a uplifting euphoric high and made me drowsy but was perfect to just relax and chill to. Dddream a little dream of me\\n\\nI feel heavy like sub bass on my face. And warm like a campfire. This strain is incredibly strong and powerful. I smoked a .3 and passed out on my friends kitchen counter. constantly very thirsty and a pretty dry mouth too but after the rocky start, the euphoria and giggly happiness sets in. everything will be hilarious for a few hours but I had serious trouble sleeping and started imagining things that weren\\'t happening. Not exactly hallucinations but believing illogical things.\\n\\nAgain this strain is seriously strong. If you\\'re new to smoking and/or have a low tolerance, use this strain with caution. Major head and body high. Feel like I’ve been floating overtop my couch the whole night. While extremely relaxed I’m also still able to concentrate very well. I have to say I’m definitely a fan of this, perfect strain to smoke when you’re just ready to escape the day or pulling yourself out of a depressive and anxious state. As an all-round strain, this has to be number 1. There are heavy indicas, electrifying sativas etc, but if I had to choose one strain to smoke forever, it would surely be Wedding Cake. It\\'s probably too relaxing for wake-and-bake, but I\\'m not a wake-and-baker, so for everything else this is perfect: smooth but not stupefying, it makes you giggly, it soothes muscle pain, it relieves anxiety, it\\'s good for sex... and best of all, I don\\'t think I\\'ve ever had a bad batch. Even very average grows are good stuff. So this wins over OG Kush for me as the best general strain for daily use. Perfect for both getting ready to go out and getting ready to press play on that series you\\'ve been wanting to watch (or right in the middle of)! \\n\\nA stellar indica vibe that\\'s perfectly-balanced \\n-toward-mellow that miraculously doesn\\'t leave you feening or totally put you out. \\n\\nA memorable 5-Star burn. Amazing lemony flavourful strain. Great euphoric and chill high. Nice....... like really Nice! Her buds are dense and she has a pleasant aroma.I feel as though I could get up and function.........but I don\\'t wanna lol.Little hungry,but not enough to do anything about it.This is my kinda high.Give it a go,think you\\'ll like it. The first time I smoked it, I Greened out so bad and it was amazing I loved every second of the high it felt so night but it hit way harder then I expected 🤣 got wedding cake from lifted cannabis at 36.00% total thc. it was $45/3.5g. it was sweet tasting, a bit like vanilla as the strain info says. this stuff hit like a truck, and it was nice. for an indica, it barely made me sleepy, which was nice! however, i was very relaxed, so i wouldn’t say this would keep you up at night. i was conspicuously impaired in a few ways, like slower reaction times and difficulty typing. i would recommend this strain to anyone! Is the best pre roll out there Wanted to post a picture, can not, Sorry This strain was a uplifting smoke, i truly headed stright to cloud nine. It was not an overpowering high but put my nerves at ease. It almost gave my eyes a shutter, like life was moving in short lapses. Great smoke if ur listening to music or doing chores around the house. The taste was unique, it had a slight taste of vanilla but was oversaw beacuse of its woody and herbal flavor Feels very indica dominant. Very relaxing with a sweeter vanilla taste that isn’t overwhelming. F$$KING BRILLIANT. Tastes great, and hits nice. Got me extremely relaxed, yet euphoric Taste is verry intense, high thc en great smell 1st named strain I\\'ve had, so starting from scratch, but definitely a strong indica, despite the limonene, and definitely a creeper. However, as an avid smoker of everything from D8 to D11, I will say, the potency is surprising. Personally, definitely helping with stress, relaxation and sleepiness. I\\'ve always enjoyed this train for its powerful pain relief and sedation while still being able to get things done if you need to. I recently grabbed a half ounce of Ozone wedding cake smalls here in Illinois for $115 out the door which is an exceptional price for medical in this state. it has a very good cherry vanilla/doughy like taste especially out of a nice clean chillum and puts you where you need to be. Definitely one of my favorites for an indica dominant guy! Went to mcdonalds high and rode bikes w the homies had a blast with this fucking strain im high ash wearing sunglasses at 8pm for no one to see my eyes 10/10 would smoke again Perfect for decompressing after a busy day. Helps slow (or completely halt) my busy racing mind.  Definitely better for evening and when I don’t have anything that you have to do.  Also helps when I have trouble sleeping. shit hits I deal with severe chronic pain and have been looking for a “go to” strain - I’ve found it. I have an incredibly high tolerance so many strains don’t touch me.\\n\\nMy pain is mainly chest related and this is an incredible body high. Since it’s chest related I find it hard to eat and within a half an hour I’m able to have a full meal no matter how bad the flare up. I recommend getting it from Spinach as the vanilla flavour seems to be stronger, but WeedMe was also nice. A potent strain. I feel relaxed and calm. Muy Bueno I give it 5 stars simply because of the texture of this weed. It was so fluffy and easy to roll up in a blunt. Gave me decent energy to do things during my day. This is currently my all time favorite strain. I’ve been looking for an Indica-leaning hybrid that would not put me to sleep, and I found it. This strain relaxes the body while stimulating the mind. I can see how some might feel some paranoia as it induces some major introspection. Brings those buried thoughts/feelings to the surface, but to me that is super therapeutic. I find myself to be super outgoing/talkative when using this one, and also relaxed. Stretching feels amazing, and exercise is sublime. I love swimming laps in the pool with it. Only complaint is the major cotton mouth, but it’s easily remedied. Oh, flavor is also a plus - has that hint of GSC baked goodness with some vanilla notes as well. Honestly, though, this could taste like ass and still be my favorite strain. Great for pain, social anxiety, and the bedroom, lol Got baked pretty quick with this! One joint knocked me out for a few hours and a few bowls got me through the night! It tastes the food just got taken off the grill, and you just get that backyard barbecue smell.\\n88.6/100 Pretty clean relaxing high. For an indica it really doesnt make me tired and the come down is incredibly smooth. In medium doses I experience almost no negative side effects.. a slight dry mouth and couch locked, thats about it. Completely free of stress, worry, and pain. Totally euphoric. Tastes of pine/pepper and a sweet creamy flavor. Very enjoyable flavor profile. Awesome strain! yes Nice and relaxing strain. pretty good This weed is great an amazing  taste but the down is it burns very quickly in a joint. Smooth fruity taste definitely for the veterans experience level. Would rather just below tangerine haze and fruity pebbles definitely top three though.  Excellent strain Some number of years ago, I came across a really nice description of Wedding Cake and had been obsessed with trying it ever since. Papaya Cake had been as close as I could get, but my dispo finally got some Wedding Cake carts and... it was worth the wait!\\n\\nI don\\'t often come across strains that feel like they\\'re made just for me. Particularly from like late afternoon through early evening and even as a nightcap, Wedding Cake seems to check a lot of my boxes: Nice balance of body and mind effects. Helps to alleviate some of my pain. Alleviates stress and anxiety. Helps me to relax... However, I also feel like it\\'s one of the most delicious strains I\\'ve ever tasted. It\\'s got such a nice, sweet yet balanced vanilla with like a flowery backdrop. The smoke also just has this very creamy texture to it. (And no, I don\\'t think this is just psychosomatic.)\\n\\nFor me, a WC high starts with in my limbs where my joint paint starts to dissipiate. It starts to get... well, not quite tingly, but it\\'s almost like my hinges have been thoroughly oiled (🤷🏼\\u200d♂️) so it feels like there\\'s less resistance or like gravity has been turned down or something. Then it creeps up my neck and begins to bloom into my consciousness from the base of my skull. By this point, my stress vanished and I\\'m just in an incredible mood.\\n\\nAs someone who tends to like hybrids more than either a straight sativa or indica, my read on WC is that is smokes very true-to-life as an indica-leaning hybrid. In addition to Pineapple Express, which has been my go-to for early-in-the-day imbibement for a hot minute, I think Wedding Cake is definitely going on the \"strains I will never not buy when they\\'re available\" list. nice for flavor Best ever strain would recommend anyone, best taste! Been aroused by having. Lots of loving feeling! Sedating enough that it\\'s perfect for a nice relaxing time, but not too much to the point that you\\'re totally couch locked all day. Getting out and enjoying the beauty of nature is always a good idea with this strain, in my opinion. I don’t normally go for such a high indica but my lord this, pardon the pun, really takes the cake. I definitely feel how strong it is and have admittedly overdone it a few times, but once you find the right dose it’s a great strain. Yummy flavor too :) My favourite by a lot 10/10 Amazing flavor color and wonderful My experience with Wedding Cake has been all positive. Amazing flavor, easy on your lungs and an intense albeit short euphoric buzz that settles into a relaxing body high. Primarily I buy this strain to cope with body pain and of the day work stress. I’d liken smoking this strain to drinking a cold beer after mowing the lawn on a hot summer weekend afternoon. My experience with Wedding Cake has never led me to feeling anxious or paranoid even when I inadvertently over smoke. If you’ve never tried this strain or you’re new to cannabis this is the perfect starter bud. Was ok. Not my favorite, but I would use again for body pain relief if my favorites weren\\'t available. This wasn\\'t too intoxicating, it would be good if you want to use it socially. Smoked this while watching the South Park 25th anniversary. Best decision ever This strain was the first to ever give me couch lock and when I say I was locked, I WAS LOCKED. Took about 2 hits while watching a snoop dogg comedy special and I did not move an inch til it was over (from the couch to the bed). From this point I slept fantastic and woke up feeling great. The flavor is frankly undesirable, but if you can get past it, it’s a great nighttime strain :)\\n\\nP.S. the cart itself stinks even with the rubber cap on so be aware if your trying to stay on the downlow Over there years out of all the WC\\'s that I\\'ve smoked from different companies, prices ranging from $20-$60, I can say that this high will remain the same with a lot of them. A good day time strain for those who like that \"relaxed but not too heavy\" feeling. Tried it many times at night but doesn\\'t help with trying to sleep. this strain amplifies music in a special way. I can listen to any genre and it\\'s magnificent. ohman I got high enough to hear the pigeons in white noise. These are exciting times! After smoked I can taste vinalla ice cream cold like to cold like coughing cold dizziness dry mouth right after burning in right foot tryed drinking water didn\\'t help than had a panic attack so bad I thought I was going to die shaking like crazy this was so bad I was thinking about stop smoking never felt like this before Just lovely really. \\n\\nUnique euphoric / introspective high that kinda creeps up on you. Pretty potent too (TAC 34.4%). \\n\\nNot sure it really makes much of a difference, but the joint I smoked was labeled —Wedding Cake 4DD— Strong peppery smell and taste. this strain is my comfort strain. i can find it pretty much anywhere in flower form or cartridge form and it gets me perfectly stoned. its also true to its hybrid name, i can be motivated or totally chill. its mellow enough for you to be stoned but not be orbiting uranus? seriously tho id recommend it to anyone. love this hybrid! Decided to take a fat rip out of my brand new cartridge one night a/ my man. I knew I was out of once his blue eyes started turned bright green. Couldn’t stop laughing for about a full hour. Emotions were all over the place for the next 3 hours. But, had a great sleep!\\nA++ would try again! It\\'s a great strain especially outside and makes me just wanna sit on a bench. Also it actually smells like a cake with lit candles. Being inside for me ruined it tho. First time trying this flavor. 🔥 It’s a creeper bruh, so USE ⚠️! Definitely a 1 hitter and wait a solid. 💯 Recommend!\\n\\n✌🏻 💕 personally one of my top 5 favorite strains of all time and I\\'m no rookie to the game This seems to just smooth it all out for me, very enjoyable and flavorful Instant relaxation. Full body chill with calm mind. A few puffs before bed has been great for my sleep. Shit was gas!!! Takes the edge off but nothing special at all. 30 percent THC listed for my Wedding Cake flower. This is the highest THC percentage in a flower I’ve had up to this point. Along with a sky high THC content the buds look beautiful. It’s gas is lemony in smell with hints of pepper and citrus. It’s main terpine I think is lemonine. And hold on I think I’m forgetting something. THE HIGH. The high is great for people suffering from anxiety and insomnia. Nice body buzz with a buzzy head high. Enjoy! I had a spinal injury in the military followed by 5 spine surgeries. I\\'m  grateful to leafly for research capabilities for strains suited for my symptoms rather than bags of pills that don\\'t work.  I have dispensary access and am opened up to a world of medicine from dabs, pre-rolled, flower, you name it.  If don\\'t  have the symptoms, I  don\\'t treat it.  I can choose wedding cake and know that I  am going to be relieved of pain and allow me to get great sleep started.   I keep this for myself. Just picked up 7 grams of wedding cake. Took two tokes and the effects were immediately awesome. I feel relaxed warm and stress free from a hard day of work. Would definitely recommend to the frequent smoker. Plan to go make some food and watch the Big Bang theory.\\nPeace, love, plants! I would say this is like a “standard” high. Light, fluffy, ,,, it’s name is actually fitting. Easy to sway from convo to convo. A very friendly vibe This strain IT boyyy 🔥🔥 Just got some Wedding Cake shatter for the first time and it\\'s a really good Indica. Feel relaxed, calm, helps with racing thoughts. Good strain all around. Prefer Indica over Sativa any day. Saliva seems to have a bad interaction to my Bipolar meds, and Indica seems to work well with them. Highly recommend this strain, and especially Indica to others who are also on Bipolar meds and any other psychotic meds. Good gaming strain very tasty energetic high definitely would get some again it came with beautiful buds with no leaf nicely trimmed Having this strain in private makes me relax in bed and kick back with a calm happy feeing flowing throughout my entire body. Helping my back/foot pain easing my insomnia and giving me plenty of an appetite. Wedding cake, makes me want to eat an entire wedding cake and it is just as delicious as one. While using this strain public is a mood booster and way to get throughout the day with a permanent smile on your face it makes any event enjoyable to to the absolute extent. Oregrown Cured Resin Cartridge of this is a definite favorite of mine. Got me pretty high and you can focus but eyes get dry I get my weed from NOBO in MI and they have great deals daily with some of the best staff with great customer service. This is probably my new favorite strain for the evenings when i just want to kick back and relax.\\n\\nIt provides a body heavy feeling and a calm sleepy mental state. This isnt the best strain for work or morning use though since it does make you quite tired. \\n\\nWould recommend, great taste and high. 5/5⭐ I like the strain if i want to get high and just chill with my boyfriend When I have wedding cake I smoke that shit so fast, it’s so good, it tastes decently good and gives a high that usually puts me to sleep or a relaxed state. One of the best strains to help with my anxiety definitely made me feel flirtatious for my man when we smoked a fat toke 🥴💨 Very  smooth and the smells is amazing. I did have a little bit of paranoia but that comes naturally for me. good strain. Instant head high. It was also energetic. It is a powerful hybrid, giving both the mind and body experience. I was both calm and acutely aware of my body and how it moves. It was also very strong in the amorous effects, not a problem for me. The munchies are present, but not strong or loud.  Calming, motivating feel for me, but I could also kick back with a game and chill too. Tastes delightful. One of my favorite strains for relaxing in the afternoon or evening. Just makes everything better I Just Really Love ❤️ This Flower and not\\nAny Other Way! I Just Choose To Smoke It \\nOkay? Thanks Again For Your Time 🥴😵\\u200d💫💥🤠😎✌️👍👽🛸👀🤭 Ooops I Gotta Go and Take a few Hits for My Birthday 🥳 Thanks 🙏🏻 I’m going now!! Okay 👌 Clark C. Awesomeness all the way around! Very similar to the way gelato 🍧 tastes! Smooth, Candy like flavor. Very strong mental and body Great for winding down after work. Lulls you to sleep. It smells so good when you are inhaling sweet smelling aroma. made me want to lay down gave me the munchies and aroused me some. overall a really good strain Ghe I’m one high guy Really reminded me of cake batter. Like vanilla cake batter. My mind just came up with idea after idea. Very euphoric high but beware of dry eyes and thirst. No dry mouth though, I was only thirsty. Kept me up and going, I felt so much energy. Winding down is easy, and you fall right asleep. Be careful of hitting too much, as you may experience a buzzing head tingle. Definitely a head high rather than a body high. Love it One of the best indica strains ever it’s tied with SFV OG Kush for me at #1 potentially After a crazy wedding weekend, our good friends gifted us with this strain. It is AMAZING! I feel so relaxed and in tune with my body and husband. Definitely a tingly high! One of the best strains I have ever smoked. Very nice, relaxing, a very good strain after a long day of work. Especially for people in manual labor. Don\\'t take my word for it, try it yourself! Everyone reacts differently. Was very calming, and great for getting “in the mood” Had me eating for an hour Definitely a new favorite of mine. The smell is amazing, almost reminds me of captain crunch it’s so sweet on the nose. It smokes smoothly and has a really nice level hybrid high. Highly recommend Made me sleep really well last night, but the effects during the high boil down to mostly a foggy brain. Doesn’t help my pain (especially not nerve pain) and is overall not my favorite of highs, especially alone or during the day, but no particularly unsavory effects, thankfully. Tastes like butter at first and then vanilla, just like cake. Makes me feel lazy tho compared to some hybrids very introspective Very strong and very potent the sweet taste was very good This is probably one of the best hybrids i’ve ever smoked. Incredible body high, with a cerebral buzz that will leave you grinning from ear to ear! Taste was incredible of vanilla cream candy. Would highly recommend! Smelled amazing and tasted great I switch between Wedding Cake and Jupiter OG for my night-night treat. WC seems to mellow my anxiety and ease those stressful muscles. There are no surprise flavors that hit your taste buds on inhale, and the exhale feels like the guitar rift in “Like A Stone” by Audioslave. <3 BR Based This is my go to night time strain. I get the couch lock or bed lock lol. It makes me feel so comfy and safe. I love to smoke this and cuddle in bed with a good book or video game to wind down for the night! great body high. but damn these munchies I don\\'t wanna move lol 🤠 8/10 would purchase again. Decent head change even though my tolerance is decently high. Love this strain. Happy stone and exceptional “medicinal” effects.  Still trying to experience those terpene flavors.  Pot, with a few exceptions, still tastes like pot since I started smoking.. It’s igh Amazing strain just bought my first bag of this and I shall be back 😍 Absolutely loved how relaxing this strain is and it just melts my pain! Rated 3 stars only because this strain causes me to violently cough after smoking. Tried this strain last night and it was quite a pleasant experience. I have a kind of a low tolerance because I quit smoking for a long time. I was in a better mood, and was calm and relaxed for the most part. I did just get a tiny bit anxious a couple of times but I have and anxiety disorder anyway so it was not near as bad and I was easily able to combat it and put it aside. Usually when I get anxious about something I fixate and ruminate on it but this helped me to be able to put most of it aside and relax a little more. I would describe it as a pleasant and mellow experience. I didn’t smoke a whole bowl I think I ended up taking about 5 hits spaced out just because of my low tolerance. I’d definitely try it again sometime and recommend this one. I really enjoyed it for the most part. It offers all the relaxing features of an indica but that little bit of sativa gives it a pleasant and happy feel too. Picked this up at Show Grow Ramona ! Worth the Visit, they consistently supply High Quality California Bay Area strains. Been waiting to try this one :) Jus picked up an 20$ 8th here from the dispensary. I live in LasVegas, Nevada. This batch of WeddingCake was harvested on 4/22/2022 and its 5/23/2022..suuper fresh ! This also has to be one of the Densest batches of WeddingCake I’ve ever had. Suuuper frosty and sticky. THC coming in @ 24.65%THC. Such a great relaxing after work smoke. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED TO ANY AND ALL MY FELLOW STONERS.. First off, I\\'d recommend this strain to medical and recreational users alike. I\\'m just trying this strain for the first time. Smoked some in a little pipe. This strain is quite aromatic! The scent is hard to pin down. Pungent for sure, almost savory & slightly sweet? Wasn\\'t harsh at all even in my crappy metal pipe.\\nThe high hit almost immediately. I\\'m feeling so relaxed and euphoric. For full transparency, I\\'m currently taking other prescribed medications for pain and anxiety too, so those may be part of why I\\'m feeling so good. But man this strain is great. I actually find many strains make my pain worse! And pot seldom offers pain relief, mostly just some relaxation & a way to help me give my undivided attention to just vibin & chilling the f out. Which has an indirect positive impact on pain level since stress makes it worse. Anyway, I\\'m rambling. I feel euphoric, chill, my whole body has a slight tingle, and although it\\'s making my brain feel a bit weird, it\\'s not as like, inebriating as some other strains lol. This has me feeling like I\\'m fully present & mostly capable of basic functioning. I\\'ve also got hella munchies lol, which is perfect as I struggle with appetite & unwanted weight loss.\\nI think this would also be a great strain for a semi social environment. This is one that I\\'d love to partake in with some good friends, snacks, maybe a movie or board games, & like half a glass of wine. This strain… wowza! Helps ease my lower back pain due to old injury, literally helps me  stay focused at work; I was on adderall before but I wanted to smoke a strain that could help me in the same way adderall did. As i already Take 4-5 medications for my PTSD, BPD, BP2. I smoke it and. I get home from work and it helps me sleep, AND keeps me up and focused at work during the day!! so I smoked it about 4 hours ago and it’s an amazing bud. I rate wedding cake a 10/10, it’s sweet and delicious still taste the flavor in my mouth from four hours ago!!!\\nWedding cake is the best strain I definitely recommend you try this flower for real!! My go-to indica strain for sleep assistance. I suffer from ADHD, and this strain is perfect for slowing down the endless train of thoughts enough to get to sleep. My wife and I picked this up the other night as our back up choice and man it did not disappoint. We both have pretty high tolerances and this stuff had both of us feeling very mellow but super talkative and laughing at everything. Be careful though bc you will empty your cabinets. This stuff is GAS! Been smoking on and off my entire life, but been really consistent with it the last couple of months and my tolerance is pretty low so usually I use a dry herb vape pen on a lower setting and gradually kick it up as I’m getting used to a new strain\\n\\nPicked this one up yesterday and as soon as I ripped off the seal the smell smacked me in the face. Smells mostly earthy and citrusy. \\n\\nBreaking the nug apart it was super sticky \\n\\nProbably took 2 hits on 360 degrees and felt instantly relaxed but it didn’t last long so I took a few more and cranked it up to 390 degrees\\n\\nHad a really great body high and felt super relaxed which was the most noticeable effect, also gave me a slight mood boost as well made some more stuff funnier than usual, but I felt like it was a super clear headed high. \\n\\nDidn’t feel mentally intoxicated at all which was fine because I just like vaping to wind down after a long day. \\n\\nI’d say if you are using this for pain this would be fantastic. Picked up wedding cake from herbel wellness at night and it was more on the sativa side. Left me feeling paranoid and anxious. It’s a absolutely delicious.  It made me feel blissful.  Incredibly happy. Great for relaxing and gets you smacked . Wedding cake is becoming one of my favorite strain as well as in my town. The effects hit you fast but not a harsh taste in your mouth after. Last awhile Best smoked between noon-4, \\n\\nIt has the best of both worlds—slight euphoria from sativa and sedation from indica. Not too extreme for either. \\n\\nVery mellow. Nice come down. \\n\\nBest for social more than music, but still good for jamming…\\n\\nStill gave the stash away to a friend because the euphoria (or the high) is not very happy, just trippy Such a fun high! Also allows you to focus if you want to while still renting\\nenjoying the ride Not my favorite strain but this is by far one of the best strains for pain relief and physical relaxation. I had trouble sleeping with this and so did my husband so we wouldnt use this strain unless we needed some pain relief. Not ideal for the day time because mentally you will be out of it haha. Perfect for a day in, sitting and chilling for hours with complete body relaxation. I know a lot of people that are fans of this strain so would recommend Notes for myself \\n\\nReally good strain. It will keep you in the couch for a good time while you enjoy your high. Later going to sleep while very relax I didn’t really feel shy effects from this one, sadly. Buenisima The best strain I ever smoked by far. The high was very intense, Yet mellow. The taste was very interesting and had my tastebuds all over the place. It also has a very euphoric effect, which was lovely! Also choose this strain if you want help with sleep. I woke up well rested. 5/5 stars for me I would recommend this strain to everyone! 💯 Great, relaxing high. Perfect for relaxing at the end of the day A dream to smoke, tastes amazing, listening to music on my headphones, playing the last of us, totally chilled, munching away!! Makes very hungry😂11/10 would recommend \\U0001faf6🏼 This strain absolutely catches you by surprise. I find it helpful when I need a good laugh or just a wave of euphoria. I can smoke it during the day or at night and feel the same way. It’s a powerful strain. Ok I felt very euphoric and it helped a lot with my anxiety and depression. I was even laughing to myself when I was laying in bed I had a long day at work, my muscles were aching and I didnt feel like making dinner. I packed my bowl with a nice nug and sat on the couch for a few minutes... started getting hungry,  got up and was motivated to cook some pasta and sauce, then ate to my hearts content, now I\\'m enjoying my buzz and my full tummy. Feeling pretty chill and my body doesn\\'t hurt. this tastes like yamdondon 10/10 my fav strain. Always tastes good, and makes me nice and calm.  Definitely recommend only smoking a little if you’re trying to be productive lol, if you smoke too much of this you will be couch locked 😂 One of my favorites :) The high hit pretty quick and was relaxing. Boy oh boy I’m glad I found this strain. It’s the perfect mix of sativa like euphoria mixed with a great body high. Love it! Great indica dominant strain that leaves you relaxed and feeling good. Makes you a little sleepy but not as much as some other strains do. Best part about this strain is the aroma/taste when you smoke. Overall great smoke and great high, only downside is the pretty severe cotton mouth you get. Definitely a banger gets me going after 3 hits crazy. love this strain :) felt super bubbly and giggling, got reallyyyy hungry lol “Wedding Cake” is an Extremely HIGH END Flavor. If it’s available, GO FOR IT! It Averages in at a whopping 24% THC! After smoking buds daily (from seeds & sticks/“regs” back in the day,) to the HIGH END Medicinal cannabis flower of more recent years, I can assure you with full confidence that if you’re a seasoned smoker & are looking for the real deal, this strain will never disappoint! Top effect for myself (having chronic depression, ptsd, & slew of anxiety disorders) would have to be RELAXATION. The taste is just amazing. The high is really enjoyable and relaxing. This is for sure one of my favorite strains. Simply the best. Available in Houston tap in Very nice strain sweet and everything. Super tired after 2 hours approx but overall uplifting at first man, i love this strain. it\\'s my daytime relaxation and pain relief strain. it helps me actually sit and enjoy tv or video games instead of focusing on my joint pain. also a good naptime strain. so strong, I thought three pyramids were floating in the air Kicks well at first, long body high and dizziness afterwords. Makes me a little nauseaus too maybe it was because I got it from a Denver dispo right next to a university, but this strain was really disappointing. Wedding cake is a favorite strain that both myself and my mother enjoy for the balanced effects of this indica dominant hybrid. We use this for the medicinal effects producing calm, pain relief with the added benefit of the munchies. The limonene gives a lemon cake flavor of smoke with just a hint of mint. Very euphoric for an indica leaner. It seems like the best of both worlds with the relaxation of body and mind. This was trash and I’m sad I even bought this on sale pharmacann y’all gotta do better!!!! It makes me happy with Oreos Used a king palm it what really good flavor and a slow burn Delicious aroma and taste! I was super pleased with the super fruity taste. I’m definitely going to buy this strain again. The nuggets are covered in beautiful crystals and grinds up nice and soft. 10/10 would recommend. Amazing. Love at first hit. Somehow made everything I ate taste 100x Sweeter. Only negative was that I was dizzy. 10/10 Flower Will be trying this again. Super fun, great strain. Had me feeling a little flirty and fun with none of the couch lock I usually get from strains that lean indica. Very smooth. Like eating a vanilla frosted cupcake with lemon curd on top. I feel like smoking this at a fancy function with a suit and tie next to some lemon pepper salmon with a chilled Pinot Grigio or a similar dry white wine. Flavors of sugar, vanilla, lemon, and a bit of graham crackers. Great for celebrations! We are yet to have a proper smoke so this is our first temporary view. So will be 5 stars probably next time.\\nWe rolled and smoked two small ones. High.. \\nWould suggest a chilled but light environment with mates. It is lively and funny. Really nice smoke. Gets your wrecked. Perfect smoke after a clicky day out got me very high. got me the munchies This is my first strain ever. I hit it and the smoke wasn’t as bad as I thought it would be. I felt like I was in a bubble, I did not have the munchies but food did taste better. It was kind of like a trip to be honest One of my personal favorites makes me feel so happy and excited for life (which is rare) !!! a little pre-nap thing or something to take the edge off a hard day. not really something you get a crazy high off of though Don’t smash it into your lover’s  face !          ( where did that barbaric custom begin? ) Smoke it !!\\n\\n  I became instantly relaxed ! My complex responsibilities were aided by this strains concentrative qualities & before I realized …. I had completed them all !  There were things in my mind that were effecting my performance & this strain eliminated them all  ( Boss ! ) \\n\\nHey Eddie ….. let’s party 🎊! Wedding Cake has become one of those strains for me that serves as a brick in the foundation of my cannabis inventory of favorite strains. It is a very straightforward, middle of the road hybrid that doesn\\'t hold any tricks up its sleeves; what you feel initially is what you get with this strain, there\\'s no \"creep\" quality to it, and to me not much of a cumulative effect either, I feel similarly stoned after ripping through a half gram of concentrate, as I do after taking a couple fat dabs of it instead, almost as if it has somewhat of a subtle ceiling effect. The stand-out effect of this strain that I feel, is the anxiety relief and stress-relieving component; I feel so much more relaxed and mellow after using this strain. I use cannabis to help manage my emotions, and Wedding Cake is one strain that definitely helps me stay on an even keel. I feel generally happy and smooth on Wedding Cake, similar to the way you feel waking up moderately late, maybe 10am, on a Saturday morning, when you have no obligations for the day and the weather is beautiful with rays of sunlight beaming into your room through the curtains; that\\'s one way I could describe the experience that Wedding Cake provides me. Definitely a solid strain, but nothing crazy that I would look forward to for any sort of special occasion or treat. This is more of a workhorse of a strain. Excellent body high after smoking some prerolls from the dispensary. Felt completely relaxed. Smooth\\nHits strong 3 hits and I am Comitose After borrowing a 0.2 of this i was left with a calm subtle but long high This is f^cking great strain, straight 🔥! Obvious to me from reviews that some people got some badly cured bud. When done right, this is a great hybrid, leaning indica but not sleepy. I had this as flower and oil, and both times was the same. Depression and anxiety have no chance. Had a real shit day, even smoked some other strain earlier. Took 3 hits off my vape cart  an hour ago, took 2 hits just now. Depression gone, ate good, watching movie, great chill Sunday night. Try this, there\\'s a reason this is a Leafly SOTY. 👍🏻5️⃣⭐ Very chill, nice lower THC pick Smoked this for 2 days really nice high and great sleep Amazing. Great head high and gets the sex drive going. Best strain yet! Average strain. Nothing crazy good. This strain makes you feel really relaxed you can easily just pass out because I damn near crashed. If you’ve been stressed you def need to smoke this strain love I bought Insa\\'s Wedding Cake when it was around 29%-30%, and wasn\\'t impressed. Wasn\\'t bad but didn\\'t match the hype. Will give this a try again though just in case. Solid. Great taste and beautiful sticky flower. Do not have more of to fully describe the taste, but I remember feeling talkative and happy. I love wedding cake it\\'s the best strain for me It\\'s very nice Its really good, but for me this is to much, to strong, i get this ‘’flying’’ effect too much after just one ‘J’’ and it stresses me out, so the ‘’manual breathing’’ always sneaks up on me when i smoke this, but all in all, really nice one this is easily my favorite strain I personally don\\'t really understand the hype around this one, I\\'v had it multiple times in edible form and to its credit it hits fast and it hits hard, but its just not a very fun high. in my experience activities where not more enjoyable than without it, you may also be hit with a lot of energy but the complete inability/will to move so it can be a bit frustrating in that regard. maybe theirs something i don\\'t get but at least for me, its one of the most boring highs iv had. I enjoyed this strain for sensual and sexy time activities. It tastes rather lovely, however I found it to be slightly more sedating than another limonene teperne strain I had previously used (Wedding Gelato). As a consequence, I found myself sleeping a wee bit more than I would have liked to. I was disappointed with this strain, I heard good things but was let down on every front. the only thing this strain has going for it is that it will knock you on your ass, if that\\'s what you are looking for.  the flavor is more akin to morning breath than vanilla and it is hard on the throat if you are smoking it without filtration. It makes me sleepy immediately but it\\'s not a relaxing sleepy feeling. Scout breath is a much better strain if you are looking for a nice soothing bed time high. My favorite Indica-dominant hybrid to date. It actually single-handedly made me a fan of Indica-based strains. If you’re looking for something to battle pain, chill out, focus, or get creative without using too much brainpower, this is your strain. amazing This is my absolute favorite strain. I have arthritis and fibromyalgia and this is my medicine. 💜 I put this on one of my top tier smokes very nice and will definitely leave you relaxed around the house watching movies or chillin in general would buy! tastes sweet like pussy, shit hits me hard af bout 1-2 mins later, now im higher than duck pussy! This weed will make you talkative and horny. It\\'s one of the best strains on the market and worth the hype. Perfect for winding down at the end of the day. I have only had this as GSC crossed with Cherry Pie.   I have never seen it in the lineage leafly describes. \\n\\nThe version I have had is amazing. My favorite strain. Tastes like a cookies family strain, is relaxing, muscle relaxer, helps with headache and is a great example of an indica hybrid.  Relaxes your body and mind. Helps anxiety, doesn’t cause drowsiness perfect for a hot bath and some meditation. loved it. By far my favourite strain. It hits hard, it hits good and it leaves you in a deliciously fuzzy headspace. The body high is also incredible; It\\'s really hard to focus on one particular task. Ideal for watching a dumb tv show or listening to music on the couch. How much for an eighth of this help me out yall , but I’ve tried it very relaxing makes you hungry I’m smoking a blunt right now… i’m about half way thru it and shiiiiiit i’m blownnn asf This strain is awesome! Very relaxing and calming effect….I can definitely sleep good tonight! My favorite strain so far! Smooth and sweet flavor. I have C-PTSD and this helps my brain slow down to normal speed to think clearer and definitely puts me back in tune with my disconnected emotions. Can’t seem find another strain that does that for me.  Also very good for the sexy times. 10/10 Currently vibin\\' to some Aminé, just dancing around my living room while my dog judges me lol\\n\\n10/10 would recommend to a friend. its a really good stuff This hybrid wedding cake is a good strain because it helped me be calm and play my video games better i absolutely love this strain. i am relaxed, happy, giggly and am able to enjoy hanging out with my family and playing game night with them. Nice clean pleasant taste and smell. Almost sweet tasting . Mellowed us out without couch lock Very enjoyable from start to finish Woke up refreshed after a restful sleep Smooth ascension into the bounds of wonderland but wonderland isn’t extreme like euphoria…if that makes sense. classic stoner in a movie weed. good stuff. I vaped Wedding cake, took 2 hits 1-2 seconds each. I feel pretty good it\\'s a mellow and balanced head high with a relaxed super chill body high. Not couch locked but 1 more hit probably would lock you down lol. Slightly stoney so it\\'s definitely not a strain you want to drive on.  I\\'m coherent but slowed reactions. Definitely a chill out at home listen to music, watch movies or do light chores. Works well to block out my hip and spinal fusion pain for sure, zero pain.. Solid strain for chronic pain, anxiety, it could definitely put you to sleep if you smoke a lot or stoned. If you’re looking to go to sleep this is the strain for you. The high is fairly long, very heavy sluggish sleepy feeling. A perfect smoke for that long night in the Hamic where you’re just looking to doze off. Not a great strain for those doing a lot of work and activity. Another strain that would be a last choice. nice indica (hybrid?) that makes you chill but not couch lock great  taste n really helped me wen I needed it. Great strain for relaxing Sit you on yo back. Love the taste happy high One of my favorites. Very herbal flowery taste and smooth to me. Makes me very relaxed and helps with my insomnia, tendinitis and anxiety. Amazing strain, smoke it all the time 9/10 Was the first flower strain I ever tried. love it. It\\'s affordable and well known so it\\'s easy to get. All my friends enjoy it too. I love to bake and listen to music while stoned. 10/10 would recommend! best weed ever the flavor is like a cake!! I’ve been smoking for ten years. This is definitely one of my top fives it smells like fruity pebble’s. Eve to time I roll up I feel like grabbing a bowl of cereal to go wit it😜. I love my sativas, however I got hold of some this and it’s by far my favorite strain. It doesn’t hit me like a Indica. My faves are Lemon Haze,Candyland and so on, but the taste and HigH from this kicked all my other faves to curb. It taints amazing and the stone is awesome. I’m definitely  going to buy this strain again great strain, the taste is very similar to wedding cake poptarts to my surprise, deep smooth tokes and lasting high. Great body high\\nHeavy head\\nSounds and taste are bumped up to ten. \\nSensitive Physically\\nSleepy and happy. \\nPretty damn good high. Very light effects, good for concurrent use.\\nI get really tired after use. This was a great choice for me great strain i had this some time back its reall help me out i recommend this for anyone Franklin labs and I was blown  away 😁😁😁 Wedding cake is one of my “go to strains”. This strain had me in a great mode for a while. I didn’t get a big head high. And I it smells great while you roll it too. Definitely recommend it! It’s such a great flower especially relaxing also This strained help me to relaxed and with my pain back is so good that I love it for real Very tasty flower . I picked up a 1/8 from CANNAPI IN\\nBrockton Mass. Wedding Cake at an astounding.  37%   beautiful dense buds 3.6 and cut perfect and very sticky.... Test works. Sticks like honey\\nAgain, Its made by INSA.  3.5. $60\\nSOON THIS EXOTIC WILL BE GONE\\nmention, SCOTT. They take care of you\\nCANNAPI.  OAK ST BROCKTON MA super sweet, great effects of euphoria, more of a body high, gives me the munchies lol I love this strain for a couple of reasons. It helps you wind down after a day of hard work. The high last and the taste is so awesome.  I recommend you to try and enjoy the effects of its goodness. Love Wedding Cake. Has you so happy in the beginning and slowly fades to a calm and relaxed state This is a legit relaxing indica dominant hybrid with a strong body high and a decent head high it definitely sneaks up on you the taste is phenomenal⛽️🍦\\U0001fad0 This is my unicorn! I\\'ve been trying different strains looking for a particular blend of effects and this one hits them all!\\n\\nI love how it energizes me and makes me get shit done. A small puff and my laundry practically sails into the washer. And a nice bowl at bedtime means that my husband is going to be put through his paces as far as sexy time is concerned 😉 Or, if I just want to drift off to dream land this strain leaves me super relaxed and asleep within minutes.\\n\\nIf this was the only pot I could smoke for the rest of my life, I\\'d be a happy camper. I love this strain in any form.  It helps me relax and it helps with pain and sleep.  I have a lot of different health issues going on and it’s great for them my favorite strain so far! Sweet tasting, mostly head high with clear high Got some from 8hh hemp website to Alabama this is 17.9%thca below .3% delta 9 so it’s legal. Same as the dispensary wc and def one of my favorite strains. Anytime of day strain and always frosty Wedding cake.....the one and only. Just like good marriages, wedding cake cuts and strains all possess similar  qualities that bring two types together. This strain first made its way in the free market scene grown very poorly almost like from a swamp or jungle. To be fair on the strain it still possessed the creamy sour tang people associated the strain with today. Which many breeders will say is a terpene created by a kush meeting a mints strain. Since it\\'s free market debut, it\\'s been grown very well commercially indoors, for its growth as well as effects. Grown perfectly I doors this strain is a knockout and shines in her glory. What users are even more noticing is the terpene profile grown from perfect greenhouse harvest. Some of the extracts are highlighting the gasoline and Mint terpenes you get on the exhale of wedding cake. This strain is here to stay in the library and has made many more strains to come. this strain is a great strain for those who wanna just sit back and relax. great flavor profile ,high thc Content,. all around amazing strain Concerning the variety, it is really incredible to sleep, a dominance indica that you feel directly from the first smokes. A very good body high and a remarkable cerebral calm. Its high is powerful and clear. Not recommended for beginners. Very chill but will make you eat your whole kitchen. Man. I rolled a fat joint. I’m feeling amazed. Bear in mind this was 4 hours ago. Been smoking daily for 2 years Great strain. A very happy affect without anxiety, from someone who gets paranoid easily. Felt euphoric, giggly, and a good body high. Only after affect was sleepy. One of my newest favorite strains, I get prerolls of this strain at a new up and coming dispensary (dont know if im allowed to drop the name of not), this dispensary has made my top 3 favorite ones to go to though, since its opening.\\nI can\\'t even describe the high of this strain, its just one you have to find and give a try. It is it\\'s description and so much more. Dope strain but harvest skimps your eighths to 3.1 pfffft. Awesome giggly strong goofy earthy. this shit is STRONG so be weary of your tolerance level when using this stuff. definitely recommend for chronic pain or just a good time. this stuff had me happily, heavily stoned for a good 2 hours, and I usually only last an hour or so. loved it. Can’t think of a time of day this isn’t great for. Trying a wake and bake today with some homemade edibles from this strain. Magnificent strain Mm mmm MMMMMM Got my hands on this beauty and haven’t felt better! I suffer from anxiety from time to time and this definitely helps to calm me down. Like others have stated this can be a bit strong. I took 3 hits from my bong and was stuck for a minute so use at your own risk lol. I now take one hit and I’m left daydreaming, writing, singing, & cooking lol my favorite things to do. Also enjoyed smoking this strain to Wiz Khalifa’s new album very nice vibes. & this gets your juices flowing : ) Wedding cake is honestly my go to. Never lets you down. I love how calm and relaxed wedding cake makes me feel when I’m high asf. One of my top favorites :) I love it. 2nd time smoking this strain. It’s FUCKIN GREAT!!!! Try it Got a lb of this a couple days ago.. man some of the best sleep I’ve ever had, and I have an appetite finally.. definitely helps relax and ease the mind, good happy dreams, and giggles perfect strain! I used to avoid sativas and hybrids because I\\'ve had such bad paranoia with them in the past, but this is by far the best strain I\\'ve ever had. I get the energy I want without the anxiety and paranoia I normally get. I would definitely recommend trying this if you\\'re looking for a strain that gives energy without paranoia. this strain is a BANGER! it’s been in my top 3 for years now & i get excited everytime i’m able to get my hands on it lol Oh boy this is a fun one! 30 minutes of pure bliss, followed by a few hours of relaxed, happy and clear thinking. A cool feeling that every is going to be OK. And yes…everything they say about the impact in the bedroom is dead accurate :)  \\n\\nBeing very THC sensitive I came into it a little reluctant, but moderation my friends is the key. It doesn’t take much to get where you want to go. I tried one hit, then came back 20 minutes laters for a second, measured one. That’s all I needed! Have had this strain numerous times. (SUPPOSEDLY) Never got it from dispensary tho. However grabbed some today from local shop by me. Have to say. Not to shabby. Glued me to couch and now having a Will Ferrel marathon with the old lady. Before back to work on Monday. We’re old school smokers. Doobies and the occasional blunt. Don’t really get high anymore. But,this got us laughing and having a good time like we were 20 again. Will definitely get again. I wrote the No more wedding caKE FOR ME review... adding that this is definitely not a strain to use if you want to be focused. No couch lock here, just unfocused, big time It was the most nice feeling i had in a long time. It was chill and i was just so happy and everything was just fine. We bought the strain in two different stores in Amsterdam and we can highly recommend both. It didn’t had any bad side effects. Hope you can get you’re hands on some!!! This is definitely one of my top 5 strains for sure! For sure a creeper so pace yourself but if you like to feel super stoned but still incredibly functional this is for you! I feel soooo relaxed but not tired to the point of being useless! I got an excellent deal on wedding cake at local dispensary and I was not disappointed. I\\'ve heard great things about this strain but never got to try it till Thanksgiving weekend. Definitely a high THC strain that packs a powerful punch. It’s been 2 weeks now i’ve been smoking it😍😍 omg shit taste so good… probs my favorite strain i’ve ever tried, gives me the perfect high. i can stay focused enough for school work but also verrrrry relaxed. knocked me out right after too, i slept like a baby. overall 10000/10 def try this!!! best strain ive smoked so far. this high felt like I just exhaled after holding my breath for days. peaceful, giggly. reminded me of summer afternoons with my closest friends Absolutely fantastic. will smoke again when I get the chance, really mellow for being a hybrid. My favorite strain! it definitely pulled smoothly & didn’t leave a nasty taste. very relaxing Picked some up today and I’ve had a few hits so far and this is a pretty potent strain. I’ve been going through a gram of wax a day for almost two weeks straight and haven’t taken a t break for at least 6 months smoking daily. So my tolerance is definitely very high and a bowl of this does the job nicely. Which is surprising for herb after using so much concentrated stuff. I have GAD and this strain deletes my anxiety and helps ease symptoms of my major depressive disorder a lot as well.  I definitely recommend this strain for anyone with anxiety and depression or trouble sleeping. Nice and make ya float but makes ya more aware and hungry You for sure are not saving the tip of this wedding cake in the freezer for a keepsake, but no marriage can last without it 💨💨💨 The only strain i’ll ever review because it was so amazing. Every time i get wedding cake it is 10x better than any other strain and is the best and most relaxed high ever. There’s just something different about wedding cake This one of the top 5 strains for me. Smooth and calm effects that keep you relaxed for hours. Best for at night after dinner smoking. Better have enough groceries in the house. Yummmyyyy\\nHelps with pain and hunger! my go to for a social sesh Wedding Cake is a sure fire heavy hitter. It sets the fire for a long night love session. It releases stress and anxiety and helps you listen to your own body so much clearer. It also helps you focus on the people around you… everything seems more vibrant and enchanting. Sex on this strain is 🔥🔥🔥 your focus shifts from self to really reading your partners desires. It’s amazing! By the way I’m writing this while HAF on Runtz. Which honestly has kicked in unexpectedly. Wedding Cake is superior. Wedding Cake is strong af. Certain strains worsen my neurological issue (neuropathic pain, muscle weakness), and this is definitely one of them. I see \"euphoric\" mentioned on reviews and I wonder what that means. I\\'m definitely \"very stoned / almost tripping\" while on it, but I would not call that euphoria. The munchies are real as well.  SO.. it\\'s just not the strain for me. I don\\'t think I\\'ve ever reacted so badly to any strain. All I have to say is leafly is wrong when it comes to wedding cake lineage and aka what else uts called, first off it\\'s aka pink cookies and second it\\'s cherry pie crossed with girl scout cookies not what u guys think its changed to, real wedding cake is what I just listed off\\n\\n\\nThe reason I\\'m giving 5 stars cause the real wedding cake is the shit Ive never taken the time to write a review for weed but this 100% deserves it.  Been smoking for the past 10 years and this is the only bud I dont \"get sick of\". Perfect sleep aid mellowed me out for sure. i felt very chilled out. i got a little giggly and pretty hungry. i felt a slight body high where my legs got heavy. overall a great strain for deep relaxation Popcorn buds, homegrown, properly cured. The inhale is smooth with a lot of citrus and a bit of earthiness.  Effect is head-heavy, relaxing, euphoric in nature. Definitely satisfying Love it just makes me a bit anxious This is hands down the best strain I’ve ever had. It helped with productivity, ease of anxiety, and sleep, 10/10/10/10 Love this strand Most euphoric feeling I’ve ever felt! Me and my partner’s favorite sexy time strain (or any other time reallybut we save it just for that bc this sh$& is amazing aka Orgasms for days.) No anxiety or paranoia, just laughter, tingly body feels, and good times. Highly recommend. One of my favorites. It is a flavorful strain with fruity overtones, probably due to its Cherry Pie ancestry. It is a relaxing smoke with a nice level of body sedation. One may wish to play games or watch an interesting movie or show. Great strain overall. Very good strain fast and great service I\\'ll definitely be ordering here from now on My favorite my far! I have issues finding the correct hybrid Bc I have anxiety AND depression. THIS fits me perfectly ! Excellent balance of happiness with a relaxing ahhhh . And it taste delicious. \\nMy go-to daytime strain that never makes me anxious and doesn’t make me pass out! It does the job. Found my batch at a much lower THC percentage, so maybe thats why it wasn\\'t quite such a love story. Not bad, but theres better out there. I have been diagnosed with major depression, and severe anxiety, this strain has done more for my mental health than all medications I have ever been on. This is a very euphoric strain that is light on your mind, makes you able to focus but block out all other unnecessary thoughts. Your body feels a little bit lighter, everything feels a lot more interesting as if you gained an extra sense. You guys are fucking idiots wedding cake is Girl Scout cookies cross with cherry pie not, animal mints crossword triangle Kush 23 before you guys put strain up on the site you guys should fucking do your research this is not the only strain that I found with the wrong lineage!!!! People use this for actual medicine that have real ailments and giving wrong lineage it’s fucking foul 👍👍👍 i really enjoyed this strain. i could get a really clear high but this strain could also get me zooted if i smoked a lot. Made me sleep like a rock. Not super fun because it gave me a massive headache. Good pain relief, but honestly pretty average high. I LOVE WEDDING CAKE. It’s by far my favorite. The high is strong and long lasting and gives a full body feeling of relaxation and euphoria. Definitely recommend for people who are coping with depression and anxiety like myself. Amazingly soft but persisted head buzz Great for a relaxing high, but it’s definitely a strain you can get “too high” on. The batch I’m digging into at the moment causes some pretty pronounced anxiety. Wedding Cake by: Spinach \\nVery Potent, Great Smell, Great Look, Great Taste, Great Price! I may have already review this but it\\'s well worth the second review! This is a great medicine if you have gastrointestinal issues! all cake ones do! Almost 10 minutes after my stomach is feeling fine! now for the important part how it makes you feel I hate when people write stuff and then they take forever to get to the effects but here it is! you can feel it behind your eyes it\\'s a nice body high to the point where you are not too tired or dragged down you have enough energy to want and do everything you would like and it is almost like taking a Vicodin it makes you aware happy euphoric energetic but you can also sleep in a rest if you would like! looks just like the pic It’s really strong and it makes you really sleepy. It’s a super indica. A really strong indica. Difficult to\\ndo anything except stay completely still. Great straight for bedtime! :) Wedding crashes is blowing my fucking mind. For our regular smokers out there, this even better than Bruce Banner. The euphoric effects from runtz and the mind numbing of lemon are in perfect sync in this beautiful strain. I am currently smoking the said boof and loving my life. I’d like to thank Josh, Su and Drake. Wedding crashes forever! I like it a lot. It has a good body high. Woah this stuff is AMAZING!! It’s night time just smoked had 2 joints and wowwww i feel great👍🏼 i feel like i’m floating in the air and i just ate fruit gummies and they taste so good and then i might make some ramen but this weed is so yummy taste so good and food taste good even taco bell!!! Great taste. Great for sex! On my favorite list. Picked up an 8th. Never had it before so I really like the high it gives. \\nRelaxing, calming. Good to use after work. 👍👍 bought this rosin and using a nectar collector for this strain. hits fast and slowly builds up for me. can barely feel my legs and feet, feel completely relaxed. I\\'ve taken 2 huge bong rips and holy crap AAAAAA++++++ I\\'m freakin\\' ripped hahaha me and my friends had this strain in a cart and i just felt amazing. definitely my favorite ever strain. My favorite strain of all. Always gives me the high I\\'m looking for, as an experienced smoker. Why would an 1/8th be $55 when the potency of THC has gone done? Wedding Cake goes for 29-30% THC and now you’re down to 23?!? I feel like it’s TruMeds and you guys just slapped **Guest Strain** I’m so disappointed in what TruMed has produced in the last year. It’s fine if you lost strains or messed up, but hiding it is a whole other factor. Pleasant Taste, Pleasant High\\n\\nVery subtle sweet, similar to a piece of vanilla cake and a slight fruityness under the sweet. \\n\\nThe high starts in the face and radiates throughout my whole body over time. Very relaxing euphoria. Struggling to stay on task, just kind of riding along. Sounds are very pleasant. \\n\\nWould definitely recommend. What\\'s G👀D Familia 1st off hope & pray that Everyone is Well!! I got some Wedding Cake💣🔥 actually l👀king 4 something else. Don\\'t regret it after 💨💨 bowls(right now) 4 sure I\\'m set. The flavor of peppery-citric earthy smooth flavor easy on da throat. Relaxed yet Focused and willing to do some things.... But make sure you Do if NoT U StUcK!! 🤣🤣 Be easy Familia 😎 💨1❤✌🏼✌🏼 I like wedding cake for the strong relax I feel in my body and notice in my mind. I typically have racing thoughts, but this strain slows my thoughts and relieves my anxiety. I am vaping Delta8 of this strain and there is no paranoia. Doesn’t cause extreme hunger. A gentle, enjoyable high. The pheno I got this time was super sweet creamy vanilla with very deep deep undertones of gas yet it was very loud. The effects offer a little  head haze with deep relaxing body buzzing. Super munchies, not sleepy but aids in sleep heavily. One of my go to strains that’s a personal favorite. It melts my anxiety away and helps me relax after working all day. 2-3 bong rips of this strain has me feeling good. I’d recommend this strain to anyone. The high stays on your head for a few minutes before your entire body is engulfed with the need to sit back and relax one of the better smokes I\\'ve had in awhile. nice and clean, no headaches or other common side effects. very relaxed, but not foggy. This cannabis strain is not just hype. I am happy to say it lives up to the name.\\nThis genetic line is absolutely delicious and potent.\\nWell done Probably my favorite strain .. good high, but still able to think clearly! Helps w/ my anxiety! so nice This strain is a beauty. From the looks, to the smell, to the taste, to the high itself. I could literally feel my mind elevating after the first 1-2 hits. Of all the strains I’ve had this lands in the middle. Great calming effects and almost gives my vision a yellow tint like I’m wearing sunglasses. This is a good medical strain for anxiety. Nice mellow high. Just pick some up and thought it was amazing some of the best way that I’ve smoked this year I’m in an instant couch lock and taste amazing bye-bye again I took two hits and now I want a sandwich. This was the first strain I\\'ve ever smoked a year ago. I didn\\'t smoke it again until today. It was exactly the same as when I first smoked it. In fact, it was even better than the first time. Today it was the first smoke of the day and it made me play guitar for an hour straight. I will definitely be smoking this before I play guitar going forward. I did really well and even learned half a song as a cover. \\n\\nTL;DR - This strain helped me with my focus on guitar. This is for sure how it’s described in the breakdown (for once) my best friends mom got me gram-I didn’t care Just needed some anxiety/depression  relief. \\nShe gave it to me and I forgot to ask what strain. \\nI jumped on here, figured out real quick how easy leafly makes it to find “Just a THC%” \\nBut I did and my nug was frosted than the pic on here. \\nAs I write this, it’s kicking in quickly. \\nLooking for a relaxing, get to to actually sleep, perfect high; def go get some Wedding cake. 🤤🥱 liked this one Oh wowwww…. Oh shit….  I’ll edit this later Best smoke I’ve had in a while str8 ZaZa it’s smooth on the throat fr and great to chill and be lazy asf this shit heat Got this strain for the first time in 2019 ironically on my wedding week.  Smoked a bowl and floated in a hot tub all week. It\\'s been a staple for me since then. Perfect for melting into the couch and losing yourself. Smoked a bowl about 20 minutes ago. Creeped up the back and hit fast. \\n\\n10/10. Damn. GSC is my absolute fav strain but wedding cake may be my close 2nd i like it, definitely a strong high. i have a cold right know and it’s been making me dizzy bc of sinus stuff. and for some reason this strain did make the dizziness worse. but other than that it’s great ! yes \\n\\n^ that’s literally all I wrote for a hot after I smoked & then forgot I was writing this review.\\n\\ni immediately felt very light and airy. it just made everything feel brighter, and i felt very chill vibes almost like my heart rate calmed down. \\n\\ni am also watching football, and i don’t even enjoy football or have a damn clue what is going on half the time, but this high is making me feel like football is a movie with 97% on rotten tomatoes. so basically, this strain can make you enjoy any activity. \\n\\ndef give her a try ✨\\n\\nalso, the first hit taste like hobby lobby & idk how to explain that, but i know it did and i liked it. Wedding Cake brings on a nice, mellow, ‘everything slowed down’ high and is even better with a Corona chaser. Absolutely great Amazing This was so delicious <3 It’s definitely the best tasting strain I’ve ever tried. It has an extremely sweet, nutty, creamy citrus flavor with a nice earthy aftertaste. It smells a bit like tea, wood, Play-Doh, and glue (not in a bad way). You get a strong body high. You’re relaxed, chill, happy, and euphoric. It feels like there’s a rave going on inside your brain in the best way. You come up with good ideas but you’re not very functional lol. Movement feels really good; even just swallowing. You feel tiny and weightless. Everything thing is tingly; even nothing. It helped with my nausea and put me in a good mood. The progression is very smooth and it makes you feel very floaty. I also think this strain makes me smarter in a weird way. It has a very calming comedown. Now the bad. This made me more paranoid than any other strain and it’s the only one that’s ever made me hallucinate. The peak is kinda mild and short-lived. The munchies are aggressive and it kinda messes with my memory too. Very relaxing!! I always feel so mind open and at ease. Taste is also great. I encourage you to try this beauty. Wedding Cake is probably one of my favorite strains due to its calming & pain relieving effects it gives me. I suffer from fibromyalgia, chronic migraines & post surgical pain This was a horrible strain in my opinion, Not only does it taste like you\\'re smoking seeds there\\'s little baby seeds all throughout the buds, Very disappointed! I\\'ll never purchase Verano again! One of the best tasting strains, sweet and festive like an actual wedding cake! Feelings of mainly body (and some head) relaxation, euphoria, and happiness follows :) give this a try! Just moved home and just ran out of some flower my uncle gave me. I was asking my roommate if he knew anyone with the good good, and he mentioned his best friend grew some. He called up his best friend that night and I was able to cop a 1/4 for fifftyyy. I was looking forward to smoking all day after my recovery of a hangover + 8hrs of babysitting a 1.5 yr old. 11pm on the way home, there was an accident on the way up to my house which made me wait an extra 20 mins to get home. As soon as I got home, I realized I needed to shower & get ready for bed. I was exhausted and suddenly I remembered the crip I picked up! Found a stoney playlist on SoundCloud, ground my weed and packed a bowl ASAP. Only smoked one bowl of Wedding Cake from my sushi pipe and god damn. I feel alive again. I kinda feel tingly after 20 mins but it might be bc I’m sitting on the desk and the tradewinds are blowing but regardless I feel amazing! Now I’m just big chillin in the living room in deep thought about my current business opportunities and how grateful I am for the quality of life I manifested. Also laughing my stress away- Like I ain’t about to let this nonsense stress weigh me down tf. I just automatically wanted to feel happy:)\\n\\nLove this high. 10/10 recommend. Defiantly feeling like a million bucks. i typically never go for anything indica, but this strain is top tier. A nice body buzz blended with just enough sativa that you can chat at a party. Great strain to smoke at a sesh or on a date! Such a great strain. Feels like gravity is pushing me down. I also get REAL hungry on Wedding Cake. I wish my house had a White Castle in it. This absolutely one of our favs. You feel it all over… like a forcefield surrounding your body.  😁 Nice buzz. I’m a fan of the head high and it’s PERFECTO! Very relaxing, one of my go too’s good I love wedding cake if you toke lightly its very calming and soothing very comforting to the body and mind alike. I recommend but tread lightly or you may get the dizzies from my experience but treading lightly equals good vibrations! yeah! upliftingly calming  at the same time if having a drink or wine TREad lightly or better yet steer clear ! Wow. Imagine warm blankets coming right out of the dryer repeatedly covering you in waves one after another. All while your eyes feel that good good pressure.  Pure bliss, happiness, euphoria. Which all gets better the more you draw. Really good for playing video games, watching tv, kickin it with some buds laughing making memories. Not for concentration would not recommend for problem solving. Just for a chill night where it’s ok to be forgetful. Tastes amazing. The munchies will soon kick in hard…which leads into passing out hard not giving you much choice in the manner after a few hours. Sometimes if you smoke more if you start to get tired it will throw you back on the groovy train a lil while longer. All in all. Awesome strain. Great for anxiety and really mellowing out. If you find this strain get your hands on it and ride the mellow bus my friends.. This is a great strain. I wouldn\\'t recommend this strain unless you are an old timer. It\\'s very potent, which I like, it helps me sleep. My first hit, I got so hot, I was sweating. (Coughing up a lung and blowin snot out of my nose, Great!) I was alert, productive, relaxed, buzzzzd. Because of potency, I can save money and conserve. Great strain! This strand definitely makes me feel happy I\\'ve never felt like this in a while I do feel uplifted this is a fantastic hybrid ask the covered even though it\\'s a dominant \"inthecouch\" lol\\n\\n This will definitely make you feel like your on cloud-9 \\n\\nyour eyes are gonna feel heavy FrFr...!\\n\\nDefinitely  Pain reliever\\n😁\\U0001f978 very earthy taste to it at first, almost peppery. Wedding Cake is an incredibly powerful strain. would be a good strain for newbies to enter the world of being completely fried..... Very nice high but strong for sure. Great taste! This weed has changed my life. Not only this aids with my pain, but it’s helped with my anxiety, depression and constant migraines. I work a stressful job so smoking this wedding cake helps me overcome my work stress and load. This has also helped me while working out, and suppresses my appetite. i just picked up 3gs of this bout a hour ago and i smoked now i have a amazing relaxed mood, personally i would rec this to smoke and vet stoners i would 100% buy this again. Smoking this in a Backwood 🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾⚡️⚡️🎯💯 Very nice flower. Nice relaxed feeling combined with nice high in body and head. Very noticeably effects. Makes you feel like you’re flying on a carpet and you’re loving it! Combined with its high THC, it makes you feel great! hits behind the eyes then zone out. Very relaxing, very strong vanilla and cream notes. I love it. definitely one of my go to smells good tastes good. great high. Smells good tastes good as well. Im\\nnot big on hybrids but this is one is really nice and strong. Strong and pungent indica, heavy relaxed and tingly/aroused feeling. Beautiful deep sweet taste with a note of gas and pepper. I will smoke this strain at my wedding i promise yall that! Amazing taste and smell nice relaxing strain The ride up feels nice and almost philosophical but I had the worst headache towards the end. The taste is great too so just have ibuprofen at the ready. very good flavor tasty Just smoked a fat bowl. Feel pretty good , super relaxed but also kinda energetic. amazing i dont feel as sleepy as i usually am when i smoke other strains! i like this one a lot:) really good looking weed super fresh taste is really good out of my bong Made me a goofy bean then I slept like a little baby. (Didn’t make me drowsy, just calmed me when I was settled to go to bed.) one of my favorite strains. it makes me feel delighted and relaxed but not tired. definitely my new go-to Always a good one for just chillin\\' and vibing. Couple small hits gets me a nice head high. This strain has helped my anxiety immensely. I am new to the world of legal mj so bare with me lol I have severe anxiety and bipolar disorder. Both of which are debilitating and physically painful…i just had a terrible break down last week and was advised to try this strain!! I enjoy mixing flower and wax. I have this strain in both forms. I smoke just enough to calm me down over the course of the day and so far everyday i have had gets better and better!! No more prescriptions either!!!! If u have tried everything else and are desperate….try this! Out of the 16 years of smoking this might be the best I have ever tasted/enjoyed,hope anyone else has the same experience. Great strain for relaxing very potent and taste is unbelievable Very relaxing One of my favs! Great for multiple uses. This has become a regular for my hubby and I to enhance our sex life. Every sensation is heightened. We have had the most intense orgasms while using this strain. It\\'s also great solo for when you want to relax at the end of the day and have a little bit of couch lock. This is a new regular in my lineup! Love it for all sorts of medical purposes and just for a good high as well. 10/10 Great strain xd This strain is a sprinter. No waiting for any effects, it hits you strong. Nice tingling relaxed euphoric feeling. one of my most favorite strains Nice strain. Made me relaxed and a bit sleepy but not enough to where I couldn\\'t stay awake if I want to. It does give me dry mouth but oh well. Has a great aftermath feeling well rested and great for sleep. This strain is one of my favorites love the terps the high the smoke all of the above!! More enjoyment from this then my actual wedding LMAO Absolutely fantastic I felt like a happy baby. My tummy really had a great time. I had birthday cake gelato. I love wedding cake. Wedding cake is one of my favorite strains I continue to revisit. It gives heavy Venusian vibes, perfect for a sensual date night with bae or even a cute self-care bubble bath and chill. The best part - no cottonmouth (or other forms of dryness)! ;) One of my all time favorites. perfect for a late night movie or intimate time with a significant other. a really tingly body high. If you are a new smoker, i’d suggest going a little easier on this strain, but if you smoke too much, you’ll probably just eat a bunch of food and pass out. insanely good stuff from pacific stone especially bc of price If you indulge in this strain make sure you prepare ahead of time and have your lover ready to go! ;-) It’s a sweet tasting burn \\nMouth dry as duck \\nEyes dry as raisins \\nBut it’s a good high really good really trippy Much more cerebral than I expected but I like it! Watched a horror movie on it and it was totally hair-raising. Made me want to listen to music and work. hungry then zen great fir relaxing before bedtime or if had a long day Relaxing, full-body high. Mellow, floral, minty taste. Sweet and can\\'t my smell. Are light slightly musty taste. Harsh ($3.50 preroll) Totally deep positive experience. I  appreciate WD at evening time, while I can ride around national historical park on bike/scooter. Nice euphoria level with proper chilling effect. Also extend some communication parameters and open heart to another person. This is proper name for this stain. Absolutely fooking incredible strain. I have nerve damage in my foot which causes chronic foot pain. Wedding Cake is my geaux to for pain management. Good on the Sativa side although Indica dominant😋The head rush isn\\'t too much, and after the euphoria kicks in, you slowly become stoned\\U0001faa8 Taste very sweet🎂  ⚠️ has induced some sense of paranoia in 2/10 times using it Didn’t like it in flower form too much so I made it into butter and woo, pretty good. Definitely a good balance of up and down. Relaxed and clear but very ready to go. Well it started off while I was giving my pup her night time wash until I felt those wedding bells of euphoria clear headed  relaxed sensation \\nI felt my pup had a hard day of treats and snacks and walks during that process she has anxiety and got scared of a lot of things so for being a good girl during a bath she got to have two treats and a 15 minute massage cause she deserved it with her cute eyes and paws that she over stresses and those lab looking eyes moral of the story its really good weed body weight lifted thoughts are gone and everything feels happy definitely something you want to smoke if you’re seeking a day of CHILL, i love indica dominant strains because the head high just isn’t for me, body highs are where it’s at!!! i smoked wedding cake for the first time today and was completely relaxed through the high, it’s definitely a creeper for sure and a little intense at first, but once you embrace it everything is cool. i’m kind of picky with the weed i smoke because i have horrible anxiety so i need something that isn’t going to make it worse, this strain was perfect <3 One of my “go-too’s” as it’s an all time fave ! If you’ve had King Louis XII strain then this’ll remind you of the wonders of life again lol. Couple rips off my pen and I was crusing down an open highway the music sounded sweeter , it makes me smile and want to dance ! Seriously you won’t be dissatisfied with this strain ! Another favorite. How can you not at least try the cake hella 🔥 worth your city price cause it’s good here in Florida the description of this is all wrong. Its not breed from triangle kush & animal mints..  alot of bad info on here. this strain is nice tho.. i love gsc and cherry pie so its a no brainer I’ve been wanting to try this strain since everyone talks highly about it.\\nI was not disappointed at all. \\nI haven’t felt this high in a while and the munchies oh god, so good!\\nDefinitely a must try! super energizing but the come down the crash was hard-core. not recommended for new smokers or people with anxiety. 57% body high\\n43% head high\\n\\nbody: Tingly, relaxed, comfortable, \\nFelt like I had a nice comfortable warm blanket wrapped around me. Definitely relaxed, but not a sleepy relaxed, just a vibing- \"i don\\'t care about anything that happens around me i\\'m down for anything i\\'m fucking comfy\" type of vibe. \\n\\nhead: Cold, tingly, balanced\\nFelt some psychoactive affects, but definitely no anxiety inducing ones definitely minimal on that. Didn\\'t have any thoughts racing, but didn\\'t have no thoughts at all either. This would be a good strain for anxiety imo. \\n\\nAll in all: Feels similar to being drunk. That\\'s how i would describe it. I am currently writing this w another friend (homie per say), we just smoked up, and the hash it doing wonders. The high right now is ambiguous in its natural euphoric and relaxed nature. Would greatly recommend this strain, Jolly Good Show wedding cake, Jolly Good Show I say. gas It\\'s ok. Me abs my fiance are heavy smokers so I understand our tolerance is high but the High didn\\'t last long. But when i.smoke a joint by myself I was high as hell ahahahah. Great calming, clear headed High Not my favorite cause it made me extremely anxious and paranoid but loved having sex on it Well I have ms and wedding cake after thousands of dollars I found what works best for me.The major issue is that only harmony in secaucus has this in flower strain.But great strain in my top 2 Very good ganja! been getting this and GSC lately and really been enjoying wedding cake more than any other stain I\\'ve had lately. couple bong rips every couple hours keeps me right where I need to be! a classic. make me giggly Great Strain. Love how mellow I felt after I smoked it. It’s such a nice strain to smoke, relax and watch a movie or do some art. Pretty perfect ❤️❤️❤️ Wedding cake is Cherry Pie x Girl Scout Cookies.  \\nIt is not Triangle Kush x Animal Mints. I heard this strain can help with headaches and migraines. So let’s see what happens. If Relaxes the body. Can it relax the mind? Man, loving this. This is the best strain I\\'ve had that doesnt put me to sleep. Exactly what I wanted Honestly amazing. Very calming, and happy. I would have to agree with the others who say it\\'s not good for work. unless you can focus and work then maybe be careful. As I sit here an hour into having smoked this, I can honestly say that this flower is top notch! Not the strain for me. Just leaves me feeling anxious and incredibly paranoid. Will not vape this again. Great for bedtime use. Love to smoke it at night in bed watching tv. It does give me munchies, a head and body high - heavy relaxation mode, then I fall asleep. Really liked this strain. Uplifting lemony flavor, followed by watching a movie with a grin on my face for a couple of hours. Happy and mellow I\\'ve been searching for a solid indica. I smoked some Wedding Cake last year and wasn\\'t impressed. Mostly because I was into sativa at the time. However, I just got off work and am deliciously stoned. I am absolutely floored by this strain. Definitely in my top ten. Try hippie crusher (crasher??) I forget. That shit fucked me off boy. The best strain Eva.. Great taste and smell just great all a around.. closest taste to jungle boys Hits real good Super good. Just laying here chilling. Usually I have crippling anxiety at night but after a few hits of this, just vibin. Feel pretty cool. Like this boi a lot. When burning and vaping, I tend to get a small rush of paranoia with any non-indica. Only this and good blue dream do not do that to me. \\n\\nTo me, this is a nice “just going about my day” high. Not too up, not too down, but just right. My current fav. Man when i hit this i felt myself instantly relax. Glued to the tv. Wanted to lay up with my girl and watch shows all night. Be careful smoking a lot during the day. I don\\'t really like this strain, like right after my friend and I smoked it, it felt like immediate pressure on the chest. Like it wasn\\'t heavy heavy, but it was there you know. But after that pressure wears off, it\\'s a pretty good weed 🔥 Very good weed, coming but won’t put you to sleep \\n\\nOverall thumbs up🙏🙏 An essential indica for all smokers The taste is very sweet and citrusy. Excellent flavour to try.\\nI felt quite energic, unless I smoke too kuch of it. Since the taste is so sweet the mouth can become really dry.\\nHunger increased. Just a pretty easy chill with happy/giggly vibes Wedding Cake knocks you out cold. Full body relaxation, great for sleep. Leaves you with a bit of a headache. I smoked so much of it I had to take a break it taste so good definitely a good one right here great for depression. I have been battling depression all day and I smoked some of this wedding cake and I feel way better now. highly recommend. It has that thing about  it \\n   So i know, believe be i know. \\n7g  \\n Hope who ever reads this is looking for a better day, Wedding Cake. \\nVery pleased. I got a good bag.\\n\\n\\nThanks again,  Everyone I really enjoy the wedding cake at night help me relax and sleep well. It also takes away pain and in the morning I feel very refreshed. I would recommend wedding cake for chronic pain people, especially people that had surgeries and recovering from pain. This is a great natural remedy that will help you tremendously control your pain! Definitely a new fave with a THC of 30%! Definitely not for the novice user Wow! One hit and I can’t stop smiling. Very strong but friendly.. I would say go slow but enjoy. I just took a few hits off a bowl of this and I feel really good. It got me high quickly which is excellent. Good product. I’m surprised by the positive ratings here. This just felt like a pure anxiety provoker in a particularly weird way. I’ve never experienced this exact kind of negative uncomfortable anxiety high before either. Not saying in my early days of cannabis I hadn’t experienced negative side effects or anxiety/mild paranoia but that was related more so to prohibition. So that said the effects were just incredibly negative. The bizarre thing is partner and my best friend have all had the same kind of experiences with this strain and on separate occasions. Wedding Cake was a highly recommended strain from other friends though. For me personally, this is hands down absolutely the worst strain I’ve ever had. This strain is great. I found it effective for both joint and muscle pain relief. Also aided in reducing my anxiety. To my disappointment though not quite strong enough to help with sleep, but I get great meditation time. Bare in mind different people have different chemistry. I found it has helped with my ptsd as well. My personal favorite! Anxiety disappears every time I smoke this! YESSSSSSSSSSSIIIIIIIIIIIIIR\\nThis beautiful and tasty bud will leave you relaxed, hungry, but not sleepy. Try listening to your favorite music, I suggest something with guitar- Led Zeppelin, Lynyrd Skynyrd, Metallica, etc. Keep something sweet nearby as well, trust me you’ll\\nNeed it. This strain is amazing for pain as well. Happy toking this one hits HARD & FAST for me, holy shit. it also heightens all my senses: food tastes 10x better (& if it’s spicy, it’s even spicier), music sounds bass boosted & feels as if the beats are coursing through my veins, & surfaces & textures feel different compared to being sober. i also feel like whenever i’m walking, i’m everywhere in the room all at once, if that makes sense? my only complaints are that if i move my head too much, i get a bad headache, & it emphasizes pain. i wish i could give it 4.5 stars b/c it’s not perfect but it’s definitely better than 4 stars. even so, wedding cake deserves the hype. Heavy hitter,  I been smoking before men been on the moon, so I\\'m experienced,  4 big hits of keef and im on the moon, 👋.  also the finish is heavy nigh nigh effect, I dont recommend a wake n bake. Its good, but not my bowl of tea so to speak. I love reading the reviews on here, seeing how this strain hits people differently. \\n\\nFor me, Wedding Cake is an absolute go-to when I want to watch an intense movie (John Wick or something) and just be simultaneously relaxed and completely engrossed in what I’m watching. I’ve been able to do more active things too, of course, but I don’t rely on this strain for those kinds of things. \\n\\nGo for the flower when you get around to trying this (if there is anyone left who hasn’t tried it). The nugs are just gorgeous. Really nice smooth hit, nice vanilla taste, and relaxing high after...if your looking for not fruity or Forrest flavor this is for you! This shit is Gas....it’s pretty damn strong....I only need about to hits from my bong and I get fuckin acid tripping high.....and pretty paranoid with it too......only 2% paranoia....I think not lmao. It is real good tho. Far and away my favorite strain! Immediate euphoria and my a$$ was off the couch and doing work around the house that I had put off for months! Can’t shut me up.  Very chatty and moving.  Fun, love it! Love the effects of this strain and their flavour, specially vaporized on my Volcano. Relaxing effects, good high, This strain leave you stoned on the clouds. Cerebral high also but not uncomfortable or numb, nothing like that with this strain IME. It\\'s normal to me which be classified like a medicinal strain with therapeutical properties. It\\'s my third balloon within 20 minutes, and I smoked of this strain a  few grams since a couple weeks, but this is the first time that I vaporized it, after don\\'t use the Volcano over a time, but that gonna change again today lmao! 😂🌋 I love vaporize, and I love so much love weed and the weed of my association. Blessing for this strain too! ♥ nice Man I drop like a rock after a couple bowls of this. And this strain is gonna have my bf wanting some wedding cake after I jump those bones, it makes me so cuddly lol good When you first smell this strain, you get a hash like, earthy smell. Upon breaking up a few nugs, the smell really fills your nostrils and you begin to get that nice lemony tang, almost similar to a nice lemon haze, but not exactly. This creamy lemon smell is definitely exciting, and although you don’t get much of that particular taste, after exhaling there is a nice, smooth, cream like sensation on the back of the throat and tongue. It creeps up, but just a little. When you first feel it, it’s in your mind with creative thoughts, or just any thoughts you happen to get lost in.  Every time I have smoked during the day so far, I have found myself either rearranging my shelves downstairs that are filled with groceries, and organizing them by type, or cleaning something for the first hour of this high. After an hour, the body is relaxed to the max, feeling very nice at this point. As the high goes on, you’ll find yourself either wanting to go smoke another bowl pack, or you’ll find yourself knocked out on the couch.  Definitely get the munchies at some point. This strain is a keeper for its nice mix of both sativa, but mostly indica traits. Highly recommend for anyone feeling a bit of pain, or depression. This strain is gentle, mellow, and friendly. It doesn’t hit you all at once and allows you to gradually sink into a euphoric state giving you a perfect opportunity to just be. doesn’t have a strong taste great strain! Great flavor. Sativa blend can work on this stuff and enjoy your shift!! So relaxing but also invigorating. One of the best I’ve ever had. Helps with creativity! This is by far my favorite strain. I immediately get relaxed. This is definitely an evening strain. sweet, minty, bubblegum-esque flavor when vaped\\nstrong cerebral hit with lots of pain relief\\ngreat every day strain ONE OF MY TOP FAV.......no doubt......taste like a cloud of air with a sweet fruity twist.... C.O.C.(cereal of choice)..... frootloops with marahmellows ..yep ... It’s very ok, if that makes sense. It treats you as if it’s own mind. Like you don’t know what it’ll effect you in 5 minutes. Changes your feelings a lot (and emotions) Smells amazing, smokes good, very relaxing I\\'ve tried this strain in both flower form and Concentrate -  For me I def like the effects of the concentrate best. \\nA very uplifting and happy high! It just puts a smile on my face and let\\'s me know \"Everything is gonna be okay! It will be a good day!\". Def will become one of my frequent strains. Sweet musky citrus fuel vanilla cream cookie taste. instant euphoria. creeping physical relaxation. IBS relief. stress relief. My wife who is a lightweight tried this out,  too much paranoia for her.  I found it tasty,  super chilling experience,  I was still very creative and happy,  did not make me hungry nor tired.  Would say it’s for some people but too much for many to be truly medicinal pleaser,  but still a top 25 hybrid strain Cacho This strain had been a hitter for me no matter where the it was grown. It gives a relaxed energetic high that helps me get things done around the house. The sweet and flowery test pairs nicely with the buddy high. I recommend this strain to help with a stress reset or a chill sesh. Definitely a go to weed when you want to chill with you buddies or partner. Always get high after the first bowl. I recommend this to everybody!!! Good Clean High With a Fruity Taste strong high, not sure if I\\'m a fan of the extra dry mouth on this one. quite cerebral too. energetic. but disorganized. Heavy arousal and happy feelings with this one. Still functional to do other activities, not overbearing. Relaxed high. a nice long lasting high very relaxing and uplifting . smells really citrusy. would 100% recommend Burns hot as hell. Relaxing I have extremely bad anxiety, and sometimes finding strains that don’t make me paranoid or anxious is really hard. Buttt... Wedding cake is certainly on my top 10 list of strains that just rock. \\n\\nPros: increased libido, calming, helps you sleep through the night like a baby, euphoric, focused\\n\\nCons: sleepy, dry mouth and eyes, headache(if you take more than 4 hits) Damn this stuff is good. I have anxiety and sometimes get anxious or paranoid when I smoke. This stuff chills me the hell out though! I don\\'t over think anything and just feel calm. Started out VERY calm. So calm I kept thinking I wasn\\'t actually high. Then I kept trying to pet my water bottle because I kept thinking it was my cat. I laughed at myself for that one! Then I noticed how good my smile felt. My face felt all warm and tingly and I couldn\\'t help but touch it. When I get high it\\'s easy for me to slip into anxiety/paranoia, but with this strain I was able to center myself back to concentrating on how good it made me feel instead. I had worked a tiring 12 hour shift before smoking this and so my rheumatoid arthritis and cramps from my period were killing me. About 25 minutes after smoking a small bowl my body all at once relaxed and my pain had eased. I decided to hit the hay and was starting to fall asleep when the song Lamb\\'s Wool by Foster the People started playing in my head and I couldn\\'t get it to stop. I put on headphones and turned on the song and WOW! I love listening to music when I\\'m high, but I had never experienced music like this because I was in such euphoria. My whole body was vibrating perfectly to the music and I was uncontrollably dancing to the beats and when I closed my eyes I saw fireworks in my brain! It was so beautiful and felt so amazing! It truly felt like I was ascending! I listened to a few more songs after that and I probably looked like I was in one of those silent discos. I then started petting my cat (the actual cat and not the water bottle this time) and it was like I could feel her happiness when she looked up at me with her cute lil face. I don\\'t think I could\\'ve stopped smiling and feeling so grateful even if I tried. I felt so connected to my mind and body and the universe! I then remembered I hadn\\'t brushed my teeth before getting in bed, so I did that and it felt GREAT! Great day or night strain for depression or anxiety. Really helps me chill but absolutely ZERO anxiety and paranoia. I went through a gram of vape in 4 days I loved it so much! Husband already got me another one since! \\n\\nIt helps with focus and slowing my a-type ocd/adhd brain down so I can actually take tasks ONE item at a time and get them done. Definitely put my happy ass to sleep A great strain for relaxing. Be careful, can cause sleepiness Great strain to accidentally watch a whole season of tv I might be unique in this, but i smoked this before i realized I\\'m allergic to citrus. Turns out if you\\'re allergic to citrus, this is gonna make you feel like you\\'re literally dying. I was struggling to breathe, heart rate was going extremely fast, got extremely light headed and dizzy, and it very much was not fun even in the slightest. Weed shouldn\\'t make you feel like you have to ride it out until it wears off but this sh*t made me feel terrified and extremely physically uncomfortable😰 A nice indica dominant hybrid, It\\'s pretty nice for relaxing and chilling out, but it\\'s not gonna put you to sleep. I feel that it\\'s nice for situations in which you\\'d like to feel calm but also be awake for, it\\'s a pretty great strain for that. but be careful, it will make you zone-out and day-dream if you let it take you into it\\'s heady-haze, and wrap you in a calming embrace. makes me feel alright to go to work. My fave strain I’ve tried so far.. I was previously tried sky Walker OG, and found it really gassy. So when I tried wedding cake, omg it’s so much smoother and light idk how to describe it. Way more enjoyable to smoke. I meditate while I’m high and have amazing break throughs mentally. Raising your vibration is easier with this plant. I saw ‘’my true self’ who wasn’t a body, just light. The type of light that was so bright it’s like looking at the sun, came over too me and it was like opening a door in my heart center, and next thing I was looking down at the body, my body (or at least my body this time round) and I was GLOWING, my body felt like it was vibrating and almost like intense goosebumps and tingles.. such a euphoric experience and completely at peace. I’m only writing this view because I came back to see if other people have experienced euphoria the way I did, and it’s good to see it was! I used to be anti weed and hate the idea of weed (cos it reminded me of my dead beat dad) but since trying it, it did more for me that any prescription man made drug did. I think I abused it to begin with and just enjoyed getting high as a kite and escaping life, and having the munchies and giggles with my friends. But growing up I realised if you respect the plant, it’s an amazing tool for healing. Learning about different strains for different things, eg I can smoke wedding cake and go about my day, and still work, feeling relaxed and have a new found perspective and happiness.. and if I need to chill out-go-to-sleep-chill, I would have liquorice sherbet. OH and I suffer from migraines associated with seizures, and whenever I can feel one coming on, having a little smoke is the only thing that will relieve my pain without just going to sleep. OMG I love this strain. Great pain killer, great mood kicker, makes you hungry, and I’m NOT sleepy!! It’s hard to find in my area so It’s one I cherish and only smoke when I really need it. \\nI wish this strain had an air freshener bc I would buy it. Smell is amazing. This is one of those strains on my top list hits like a truck i was having really bad insomnia and came to a point a lot of of strain weren\\'t working for me no more and i need something strong that i can com by easily and damn it was worth it was lil pricy but was worst every cent This is my favorite strain for anxiety. It helps me socialize and stop worrying about stuff. Alot of strains can make me feel dissociated and anxiety when I consume large amounts but with this strain I can smoke myself to sleep. Great Weed this is. Very Peppery Tangy Aroma and a high that\\'ll sneek up on you and give you a giant warm hug. Delicious. Take nice gentle modestly sized hits at a slow pace for the best expetience My favorite over all , helps with ptsd Great strain! Bought 3.5 Gram For my Birthdayin Rotterdam all the way from Cali 🇺🇸 Calming effect and definitely calmed my anxiety.i will definitely get this again💯 Frame by frame. If my life was a camera right now, it would be going so slow. Wedding Cake is useful for getting high fast, the night went slow and easy. Lovely. Magical relief for the anxiety, stress, and depression that comes with PTSD. Brings me to a warm and productive place for day time use and relaxes me enough for meditation and sleep at night. Also brings me relief from the stressors of tinnitus and some muscle spasms. Amazing\\n\\nI am currently stoned off my rump because of this strain and I could NOT be happier, it’s not the kind of happy that’s exhausting, this happy hits and I feel at peace/content. I’m taking things as they are and being happy no matter the outcome of whatever situation I have at hand may be whether it be me being thirsty but all I have for soda is diet or it’s slightly colder outside than I’d like for smoking, the stars are still out and everything is a good time you know ? who needs therapy when there’s wedding cake\\n\\nI think this is how being high was intended to feel like (for something between recreational and entertaining purposes) who needs therapy when there’s wedding cake, time to reboot friends.\\n\\nTime to reboot friends :) Might attack your anxiety if you\\'re not in a very good moment. I smoked on joint of it and had to be always stretching my arms and had to lay on my bed for a while fighting to keep calm.. But i\\'ve enjoyed it when i was okay. It\\'s up to you to use it My absolute favorite! Makes me calm, cool, collected, content and comfy. Haha! I just came up with all of those in my head high and they all started with a “c”!  As you can read I’m stoned.. A must smoke :) gut This is a very nice strand to smoke. It leaves you feeling very relaxed and very chill with a hint of a euphoric feel. Your still able to function while in the very nice serene and mellow state and eventually puts you in a nice little sleep. I rarely smoke. I\\'m an edibles guy. It was in a backwood so though I can\\'t give an accurate flavor assessment I can give a \"high\" assessment. Only about 5 hits and I was floating for HOURS with all I can describe as one of the most pleasant and happy highs I\\'ve ever had. Dare I call it the perfect high? I would. Amazing. Wanna be stoners leave such detailed reviews. Everybody a critic. This is a top strain. Got me dizzy and high asf. Good strain for sleep and pain relief. I work at a coffee shop and have constant arm pain so I usually vape the concentrate before bed and I get a much better and deeper sleep than when I don’t. One of my ideal highs, I feel so balanced and grounded. Calm and present. And I kinda feel warm and fuzzy.  Love it :) This strain is great! For me it’s more like an Indica. I definitely feel very euphoric, relaxed, and almost too relaxed to really do anything. I also got some pretty good munchies going. It’s definitely a good head high, as well as a good body high. I feel like I’m floating through the sky, beautiful! Some of the dopest dope I ever smoked. Lol. Smell amazing, smooth smoke, no harsh coughs. I found it especially nice after a long day and I just wanted to cool the jets. Doesn’t knock you right, but if your ready for bed this bud can help with a peaceful nights sleep. this shit fire du I smoked Wedding Cake with a friend and it was so fucking great. At first, I was paranoid about how quickly I got so high and then 10 seconds later I was so giggly and happy, just laughing at the littlest things. Everything and I mean EVERYTHING, felt super good. We kept cuddling with each other and laughing at the dumbest shit. I kept rolling my eyes back and it kept giving me a euphoric, tingly feeling yet dizzy too. Felt fucking great. Also, the strain makes you aroused super quickly. Coming down from the high, I fell asleep. 10/10 would do it again. If you are counting macros, this strand will fuck up your diet. Zero control of your cravings when you smoke this. \\n\\nThat aside, it’s a very strong fantastic strand for people who need this style of punch.\\n\\nI do not. Don\\'t underestimate this strain. Although they say its more on the Indicia side..for me it acts like a Sativa. Motivation to get stuff done! \\nI have severe Ulcerative Colitis and this strain is my #1 go to!! Excellent for Pain and Nausea!! Give it a try, you will not be disappointed! This is my favorite strain to smoke before bed. This makes me feel so relaxed and the euphoric high is (as Borat says) Very nice!!! My new favorite Indica. Great flavor too. Smooth Good look taste smell Strangely this strain had me energized as well as relaxed. A great high for several hours. Very soothing high. Not too sedating. Classic cookie flavor. Very calming and a slight pleasant feeling as well. Inflammation reduce. Anxiety reduced. Sensory perception improved. Strong sedating effects. Immediately relaxed upon one decent bong rip. Both body and mind are buzzing with calm energy. Immediately released all my anxiety and I found myself melted into my chair. Love. Amazing indica.  Got a great night\\'s sleep after smoking a bowl.  It has a sweet aftertaste and a very smooth smoke.  Highly recommend for appetite and/or sleep issues. Delicious -- smoking a bowl of Wedding Cake is like being covered in sweet frosting -- Yummmm The strain is great but the effects of this brand only shows promise for the first time you use it. Once you start a new pen, my body was already use to it - and I am not a common user, so to claim tolerance would be false. Good stuff and nice strains Deep I urge you to find the triangle mints pheno cut of wedding cake, it\\'s different than the gsc x cherry pie cut. For the triangle mints cut, it\\'s a beautiful body blanket of euphoria and relaxation, as well as a good head rush. Cherry pie x gsc personally gives me a headache and my body rejects it, sorry. its a little sweet for my tastes, depending on my method of consumption, it\\'s like smoking sugar. decently effective with my stress, but didn\\'t help very much for my anxiety. Munchies hit hard, be aware and be prepared. Smooth head high. Lazy feeling and forgetfulness. Flower brand DVS from Oasis North.  What brand is DVS?????? One of my all time favorite strains!! Great strain it helped me with my appetite and I felt super relaxed and euphoric oh fuck... this is great. \\nTLDR; This strain is a MUST try. Very well rounded POTENT high- Phenomenal for pain relief, good choice for those who wanna get fucked up but tend to get anxious from THC, seriously helped me with my sensory issues and hypervigilance. Did give me a brief panic attack, but it was easy to recover from. I’m enjoying life more than I ever have before. \\n\\nThis is a real rollercoaster of a strain. It gave me the most beautiful afternoon I’ve had all quarantine. \\nLately I’ve been very bored, not just because the pandemic is preventing me from widening my social circles but also because my agoraphobia often prevents me from going outside. Today I decided I would go outside, enjoy myself, and have a great new experience at any cost. \\nWeed is one of the best motivators I can use to get outside. Because of my household’s weed rules, I can only smoke bud if I’m far outside of the house. I walked a mile in the heat to get to the spot we had in mind, sat down, and sparked up. \\nIt tasted a lot like top shelf hemp flower, only it was sweeter, smoother, and a lot more flavorful (hints of oat, cardamom, honey, and cream). At first I was actually worried that I’d been sold hemp in place of weed, particularly because I didn’t feel the effects right away. \\nThree thirds of the way through the joint it hit me like a train. I honestly felt like little bits of reality were coming apart- All of my thoughts were in the form of archaic symbols and artwork. For about ten minutes I was higher than I’ve ever been. \\nThis lead to a beautiful moment where me and my girlfriend hugged after I expressed that I was a little afraid. This strain truly makes love feel like the kind of love people must have had for each other in the cave age; The kind of love you feel for a person when they are the one making sure you get closest to the fire after you’ve been out in the cold too long in a time where your only shelter is a leather tarp.\\nI’ve a long history of tweaking out, bugging out, and all-out panicking from THC. This is the only strain in which I’ve been able to lose that panic and enjoy the experience at the peak of the high. It was a totally new sensation. \\nI also struggle with sensory issues that often make normal sensations feel like pain- Things like my eyelashes being moved in the wrong direction or people bumping into me can feel painful, which makes ordinary discomforts such as thirst, muscle cramping, hunger, and heat/intense cold feel intolerable. I was able to walk another mile in all of that discomfort without any water and HORRIFIC dry mouth- And I was able to do that without feeling like my entire world was crashing in on me and I was in hell. I was just uncomfortable, which is a HUGE feat for me. \\nI am now completely chilled out. I feel better than I have in years. I am relaxed, I am content, my girlfriend is making gluten free oatmeal raisin cookies. I love myself, I love life. I feel like a human being again. Good strain for Gastroparesis Honestly one of the most enjoyable strains I’ve had in a while. Got a 1g cart for daytime use, and OH MY GOD. Pleasantly buzzed, makes me more likely to giggle. I also have some pain management/anxiety/ADHD needs that definitely get addressed. 100% would get again. (Orchard Heights from Nirvana, Tulsa) Bart is typing this Great taste and looks. very datk and frosty buds. great for night time chilling! The lineage is wrong GSC x Cherry Pie is actually the lineage for BIRTHDAY Cake. Wedding Cakes lineage is Triangle Kush x Animal Mints! cool I\\'m currently smoking some Wedding Cake that I bought from a friend and it is amazing! It makes watching comedy videos all the more fun but be warned: it will knock you out. Best used as a nightcap for when you\\'re winding down for the night. Smoking it, it tastes nutty and earthy almost couldn’t taste anything besides that. It’s a high THC for people who don’t smoke often so be aware.! Started feeling a head high and kinda oblivious after 10-15 min. About 30 min in I just wanted to lay down and sleep so it has a very calm affect.  My mouth got very dry, make sure to hydrate. Overall emotions are relaxed and sluggish. Definitely a good strain to smoke on a lazy Sunday ☺️ One of my favorites, a very euphoric uplifting high for me. I’m having a feeling of equanimity. (Note: Smoked with a bowl of Red Diesel.) This is my first time using this strain and I don’t smoke often so it hit pretty good. Very mellow feeling but I wasn’t glued to the couch. Only downside is that it made my tenitus go crazy. Worth it, though. It’s a excellent indica high bred.  Taste of Vanilla & lemon.    Sweet under tones of the gsc possibly my favorite strand ever. has me dancing around my apartment feeling really mf content. this strand is perfect for escaping stress and just taking a deep breath. Good strain. smells amazing. pretty decent high. I grow a pheno of wedding cake. And I have to disagree with leafly’s description of it being citrusy, peppery and herbal. My wedding cake, all I can smell is vanilla cake. Sweet sweet sugary cake. Slice into a vanilla cake, take a whiff, that’s what wedding cake is suppose to smell like. Wedding Cake is perfect for Friday night fun on the couch or with friends. It isn’t a heavy sedative nor is it radically energizing. Just a nice mellow head feeling which really lifted my mood over two weekends of use. My notes on strain are “lots of laughs, happy” This is exactly what it says, calming to the body and mind, also it does make me happy. It’s good for depression and anxiety. I really appreciate this strains medicinal purposes. <3 Probably a strain that has made me come back for this reason. My shop ran out and I am missing it for sure guys. :( This strain is one of my favorites ever had! It’s very amazing delicious perfect indica hybrid. It’s very top notch strain to use even it’s very strong high. It’s got me like 3 hits of bowl and you are good to go.  This strain flavors are perfect combo with Kong hemp wraps wedding cake. 🔥💯 Holy shit two hits and I\\'m fucking zooted, my head feels like it\\'s being hugged Best strain for sex 100000%!!!! very delicious and happy high This is one of my new found favorite strains! Fantastic high 12/10 would recommend!!! Started off with Purple Punch then Wedding Crasher, both great! Then tried Wedding Cake after reading all the reviews. It’s a good one. When picking up from dispensaries, staffs say it’s one of there favorites, and it’s getting harder to come by with its popularity. It does it’s purpose, what it needs to! Makes things MUCH MUCH better. Including the SEX! As the song goes “ All Night Long, All Night, All Night!” 😹😼 Really uplifting but also nice body high. Would recommend for athletes who deal with sore muscles or pain in general. Good high for loss of appetite but also keeping alert to keep a conversation. Do not suggest for a wake and bake as the more you smoke it the sleepier you become which I see being an effect from the GG parent hence the “glued” to the couch thing. Definitely good for those who enjoy vibing to music as well. Not in my top favorites but definitely a good high. Flavors more on the chocolate and coffee side with a tinge of a spicy pine or lemon scent. Colors varied between a really dark green, bright crystals, and hella orange hairs to a brighter leafy flower leaning to the drier side so makes it easier for the break down but also has hella orange hairs but not as crystal covered on the bright green buds. 30 minutes in and on to the second blunt. I see this one being a “creeper” so I do suggest you have more experience should you choose to toke this lovely strain. Definitely recommend. This makes me feel like a beautiful bitch...I def recommend . It’s such a cool/calming high you can enjoy ! good everyday hitter. perfect to unwind after work and relax after a long day. soft and easy. Its amazing! It\\'s good but it\\'s hard to stay awake on it, at least for me lol. Definitely worth buying for sure. For me it’s more of a body high and it’s great, super chill Be careful if you get migraines. This triggered them for me everytime I tried to smoke. I couldn\\'t even finish a bowl in a pipe. I took this strain in a home made tincture with distillate, mtc and part sunflower lethicin. At first I thought it wasn\\'t doing very much, After eating a mango and dosing a quarter dropper more, holy heck dude! This stuff is not exactly stoney but it is bordering on a light psychidelic hypnotic, with some energy! I have severe fibromyalgia and arthritis, My body went numb and feels like it\\'s being massaged, my ptsd and anxiety melted away, it even helped my astigmatism! I know this is supposed to be an indica, and body wise it totally is but it\\'s got the hybrid effects of the mental stimulation and creative focus. If your looking for something that won\\'t get you feeling out of it but put you right on an even keel, I highly recommend this strain, Its one you can really use all day! I didn\\'t really enjoy the high, made me feel weird and I was extremely paranoid This is one of my top strains. It’s definitely a creeper, so keep that in mind. The high is a relaxing, functional strain that has a really nice cerebral chill with a good disconnect from pain and stress Makes you feel all the kinds of good Smoked this just now and bought it about 2 days afo in a coffeshop in Amsterdam for 20 euro per gram, the intense high is the only reason why I give this 4 stars because the price is ridicilous in my opinion. Love the color after grinding. Bright, body high, and alive high. My face melts yet my mind is intact.  Thank you. Suffering from PTSD for 40 years, this chills the pills. Best healing to all. Yesterday I picked up an eighth from my local legal dispensary. Bllrdr was the brand on it. I was a little iffy about paying $61 for 3.5, but was it ever worth it. \\nThe smell hit as soon as I opened the container. Very floral, and reminded me of Grandma\\'s house when she was baking Christmas goodies.\\nI smoked a 1g cone, and the high hit fast and locked me down. I felt tingly all over, and it lasted quite a while. \\nI would 100% recommend this strain to anyone. But hopefully you can find a good batch that\\'s cheaper than what I paid.\\nCheers! Perfect strain for watching a movie and going to bed. Really relaxing body buzz. Loved it. Say “I do” and serve yourself a slice of this scrumptious strain. I couldn’t resist the pun. Just like I can’t pass up on Wedding Cake. This strain has never let me down. I have not (yet) encountered another one as versatile as this. My first experience with WC was before a run. It is now part of my pre-run routine. Tried it out, wake and bake, on a Saturday, out of curiosity. Would I seize or waste the coming day? I seized the hell out of it. This strain has never disappointed me: morning or evening, before socializing, while getting shit done, and even to treat mild/moderate pain and discomfort (i.e. cramps, headaches). No anxiety, no munchies, no dry mouth, no paranoia. I could go on with the anecdotes but I won’t. I’m going to go vape some Wedding Cake before enjoying my evening. wedding cake is not a cross of gsc x cherry pie lmfao. its a pheno of triangle mints. it was bred by jbeezy. get your shit right leafly. Top 3 strain and it\\'s not 3 or 2. this is my go to. i absolutely love it. Fine sativa effects that feel like a crown in your head-with an overall good mix of a staiva heady and indica body tingles that massage you all over your arms and legs. Flavor was woody-like with a fresh pine taste and a hint of sweetness throughout. Would recommend and smoke again. impairment with no other affect my first time trying wedding cake was in 2017 it was very euphoric cause time was in a stand still the whole world was trying to get there hand on this strand   time was moving as if we were all at a marriage and ready to smoke with one another I just received a few of this strain in oil. Wish I kept more for myself. Very enjoyable with a strong taste. The high feels immediate after intake. Amazing strain, top 2 for sure. Heavy indica with sedating and numbing effects. Terps were doughy with hint of lemon. Flower looked beautiful and was coated in milky trichomes Thank you to the creators of Wedding Cake 🎂❤😘 I can\\'t believe how good  I\\'m feeling! I live with chronic pain, Bipolar 2, ADHD, and Anxiety. This strain helps. And a very welcomed plus, it has made me feel as horny as I did at age 16. My hubby is very supportive & thankful for this strain, too! 😁❤ \\nThis strain is not for beginners, it\\'s THC level is out of this world 😲😄 Wedding Cake is bit of a creeper. But when it hits, I’m chair bound until I’m out of snacks. Calm and relaxing high. Smokes with a good taste. One of our faves. Heavy hitting, wouldn’t recommend for getting lit with friends. It can be a lot but if you take a hit, wait, take another, it’s easier to see the effects without it hitting to hard My go-to strain. gives the most calming, incredible high that I don\\'t find in many other strains (besides OG\\'s). 10/10 would recommend. My parter and I gave this strain a try after researching for something new, we did 3 hits from the cigarette that I rolled and the very first 5 minutes it did not hit at all, I almost went out and smoked some more but then it HIT us, we were looking for something to watch and ended up picking Blade runner, the effects were calming and I was focused on details, another thing that I noticed is that is makes you hallucinate a little or just get lost into something that interested you in the moment, then I felt very loving to my parter and kind of stopped watching then got lost in the TV again, if you are using this to have sex I HIGHLY recommend this, makes you 10 times better or whatever, but make sure you have 0 distractions around like music or TV, we ate before smoking so I did not feel hungry and we did not munch. 😌 I think this is a GREAT strain. First off, as someone else has said, it\\'s a creeper. The full effect won\\'t be felt or noticed for 20-30 minutes. At first, you get a little bit of a buzz, but nothing crazy. But then as you sit there realizing you\\'ve been staring at the same spot for God knows how long and you try to get up... That\\'s when you realize that your body has turned to stone and is very heavy to move. \\n\\nI\\'d say it\\'s a great way to take a day off from work with no responsibilities.... OR, as I have found, it\\'s great for muscle relaxation so if you have restless sleep, this might help. I\\'d also recommend this strain for meditation. It\\'s enough of a head buzz that allows you to go deep into thought. i split an 1/8 of this strain with some co workers thinking i just wanted to try it to better relay to our customers, and i soon found that this was my new favorite strain. i found that i felt very happy and uplifted with nice body relaxation. lots of reviews and people said that this was a strain that was going to be very munchie forward and i found the opposite. based off of my experience,  i would recommend this strain to anyone dealing with some depression or anxiety. it is definitely a heavy hitter in its effects Level-headed high, great for video games. I\\'m high asf right now 😊😂 Good weed Amazing! Müvs strain is the boogie,sweet,woodsy flavor,dense,big, sticky ,buds,shuts this ol thinker and other ails o mine right off,this is the type of Wedding Cake folks brag about I have a Nervous System Disorder and usually, am very sensitive to side effects. My whole damn system is “hypo-allergenic”. \\n\\nHaving said that: \\n\\n•This is something that helps with my anxiety\\n•No racing thoughts\\n•No panic thinking\\n•No more headaches \\n•No racing heart \\n(Some strains increase my tachycardia) \\n•This strain does not make you feel muddled or glued to floor or TV \\n•No crazy munchies \\n•Chill mode invoked without that rabbit hole feeling. \\n•Fully functional still \\n•I can go out in public with this one and still be in control of behavior.\\n•No crazy high \\n\\nIn short; my pain is subdued and so is mood. \\nIt’s super sweet + tasty, reminds me of an Orange Pop! this strain came with very small sticky popcorn nugs. it’s smell was very fruity and had a very pleasant aroma. the high was surprisingly weak since it smelt very skunky and strong. felt relaxed and heavy body. The first time I tried wedding cake was in a pre roll and was instantly hooked on the flavor, smell, and the overall feeling of ease it gives your entire body. It taste like the name,\\nI’ve noticed hints of vanilla, earth tones, and if you get a nice fresh batch it is sticking to your fingers like wedding cake. Wedding cake relaxed your entire body and mind. One of my favorites, euphoric and I don’t really notice any munchies. love this strain. a little couch lock sometimes but overall 10/10. Nice I picked up a pre-roll of Wedding Cake from my medical dispensary. I was looking or something that would help fight pain, I have lots skeletal pain. It has a kinda soil, sour taste but the high is so worth it.\\nIt fights pain, be careful it will fight it so well you will lose time, lots of it. I do not recommend this strain for activity, it is more calming, like right to sleep, or off on some adventure in your head. Think couch lock with an Alice in wonderland feeling. Not for the beginner. potent delicious gorgeous its just good man. Powerful pain relief with a nice euphoric vibe but nothing to racy or trippy perfect for when you throw your back out doing foolish things around your house thinking you\\'re still young I usually do edibles and have only smoked  twice before.  Since I don’t smoke cigarettes or weed, I had a hard time getting the smoke into my lungs.  I smoked 2 joints, 2 different days, but barley felt anything.  Today I tried harder to inhale, and wow what a difference.  This was the craziest day with weed I’ve had.  Bad idea to do it while working.  Sex was great!  Time moved slloooow. I was a little freaked out.  I was very energetic, I couldn’t sit.  I paced the house for 4 hours.  7 hours later and I’m starting to feel normal again. No will take it easy next time. 😬 One of my favourite strains. Great for insomnia and appetite loss also physical pain. Really strong effects in terms of feeling really chilled out after only a few puffs. Made me relaxed and giggly This is one of my favorite strains, very calming and doesn’t completely knock you on the couch. I also have multiple chronic health issues, and have pain every day, this strain is great for the pain! Highly recommend for medical use! Like I bought a quarter of the shake and its so so good thats nuts no matter how you get this strain its the goods as we all used to say back in the day. \\n\\nHands down dopest dope I\\'ve ever smoked Fire ! Joint right here gne have yu stuck and sleep 💯 Wow, this one is a creeper. Super strong and heady stone sets in for a bit, then gives way to a really pleasant tingly high. This is a good mix of a head high and body high. Any pain I had today from cramps related to my endometriosis are gone. I’m not sure this would be a good daytime stain, seems best for winding down after work. I’ll definitely keep this on board for chronic pain and anxiety! great taste, calming and almost antipsychotic effects. Soooo this is heaven uhh!! My man and I tried this strain and ALL is know is this is by far the best stain EVER!! My ass was tingling from the bottom of my feet to the top of my head!! I was like wait a damn minute is my cat😻 tingling too! My thang felt like  bubbly champagne and I was super  💦 💦. Ummmm needless to say dammit we made hot passionate who’s is this, who’s is this love!!! Like you making love in a galaxy far far away!! Hell spent the night dreaming of poppy fields of lavender. I was so high in a good way.. Can’t do quantum physics on this strain but I swear you will love it!!! Clears my head, makes me want to get things done but keeps me calm and chilled. Not a good smoke . Light and fluffy buds . Waste of money period . Thumbs down 👎🏾 light body high \\nFlimsy headache . I wouldn’t even sell this tru fusion farm anymore poor quality and taste.\\nALL bad overall condition for this strain. overhyped better off with Dolato or kosher lineup This shit is fire!!!! It’s a absolutely a must!!! made me motivated and more focused Wedding Cake has always been a favorite of mine. The flower served up at Private Reserve Gardens did not disappoint. Peppery and earthy. Large in the THC department. A relaxing and tasty treat at the end of a long day. It’s good! harsh on the throat. high potency and relaxing for the mind and body. would recommend but to experienced smokers. It’s a solid sleepy time strain.  Depends on who grows it if I buy it. It’s always a contender for me.\\nDefinetely a good one. I took a fatttt ass dab of this strain and straight taste like eating an persimmon and a orange mixed together. I just had a pretty bad injury to a long laceration on the bottom of my foot I have some permanent nerve damage and really did not feel it after smoking some of this. Rolled a backwood with this and smoked it in the car and 4 hits in I was toasted af bro definitely has a good taste like a zebra cake or something lmao. It burns so well too and overall had a good smoke with this strain The Cannabis Council \"highly\" recommends the Wedding Cake (or 3-Layer Cake to some).\\n\\nWhile THC content is relatively \"high\" , this does creep up on you and isn\\'t immediately a smack to the face. But it\\'s a nice night time smoke for some fantastic sleep. Helps with my insomnia. Gives me the munchies And a good high. I really like it. Relaxed hybrid, middle ground feelings Vraiment ma sorte préféré sa goute le bohneur, sent super bon, beau strain et fait beaucoup de thc. EXCELLENT💨 A little intense coming on, but felt relaxed later.  Gave me a strong appetite. some of the best weed I have smoked, large dense nugs, and an amazing high Very uplifting and calming while having the perfect picture of a body high and mental high. I felt really relaxed, quite clear-headed and able to focus on the TV alone, which is usually impossible 🤣\\nFelt very chilled. Fabulous tingley body high yet focused, creative, happy and uplifted. I highly recommend. One of my most favorite strains. Wedding Cake is a great strain wit lots of medical benefits to health. If u never smoke wedding cake strain then u really missing. Add mi on snap: kaliscanabis Good for dissociating from body feelings for me. I enjoyed the quick high and the intial brain feel but feel very disconnected from myself and the outside of self. \\n\\nOne hit of this stuff goes really far and if one is looking for high that leads to feeling far away it’s the right one.\\n\\nPersonally in the future this is a rare bud for me I like how this strain makes me feel overall. It helps with my anxiety, calms the noise in my head. For me, it is definitely a slow creeper and when it hits so does all the happiness. One of my favorites. i am so stoned. i am so thirsty. Dosage: 1 ml of cannabis oil equivalent to 10 mg THC, mixed in a hot cocoa drink; the oil was made by dissolving decarbed Cresco live budder in liquid coconut oil.\\n\\nTaste/Aroma: Mild and pleasant, with hints of nuts and vanilla; this went very well with the cocoa.\\n\\nEffects: These were felt within 30 minutes, built up gradually, peaked at around the 3-hour mark, then slowly tapered off and concluded around 5 hours after consumption. To me, WC feels like a 50/50 hybrid,  perhaps leaning a bit to the sativa side. Relaxation without the drowsiness; euphoria/creativity without the jitters - like taking a great sativa such as Durban or Sour Diesel along with a mild opiate. Wedding cake is a very potent and remarkably well-balanced strain combining the best of both worlds! \\nDefinitely the best \\'cake\\' from any wedding I\\'ve been at! Fantastic high. Makes me sleepy most nights but a great chill Would definitely recommended we had the cartridge. I would say I hate my life less. My boyfriend of 3 years is more tolerable.  👍 👌🏻👌🏻 AMAZING STRAIN MY WIFE WHOS IS NEW TO THE SMOKING (unlike me I’ve been smoking since the 90s) TOOK THREE HITS FROM A BONG AND FEL ASLEEP MID CONVERSATION.....DEFINITELY THE STRAIN FOR YOU IF YOUR TRYING TO HAVE A RELAXING EVENING BUT BE PREPARED TO GO MEEMEE!!!zzzzzzzzzz really good to smoke at night for some good rest or before dinner. Clear headed with good body feelings, not sedating. Love this strain. Not sure why Leafly continues to persist in linking it to Pink Cookies. Two completely different strains. Get with it folks. This strain is by far my favorite, it helps so much with pain that I forgot I was ever in pain to begin with! ITS AMAZING just by 2 hits I get super high and I feel a good high I don’t get parimos or anything like that it’s a good weed smells really good to this was very good for sure it gave me a giggling orgasm in the shower I would say 8 out of 10 for sure 😋 It\\'s tasty scrumptious, works for pain and very relaxing. Just packed a fat bowl with wedding cake. Been a minute since I had this beautiful strain - tastes amazing and hits like a dream. Pretty good got me pretty giggly It was good! I think it is perfect for any occasion weather u want to relax or do somthing I think its a great mid day night strain doesn\\'t make you tired until it wears off. Taste like woody diesel. And it makes you pretty creative especially with music for me. Best tasting and a little went a long  way which is awesome 😋 Loved it! Relaxing, will keep this in the rotation when Kish isn’t available. Eh. It’s okay for me personally. Nice relaxing high strong body high, it\\'s very relaxing but doesn\\'t aid my depression. But it is very nice for my joint pain and inflammation This is a great strain. I’m a heavy smoker, and this had me floating high. It’s got a great flavor. I would definitely recommend this strain. My favorite strain from liberty health science Tallahassee Florida! Love it!!! Pretty good indica dominant. Good enough to get me to sleep. I’ve smoked this about 3 times and it does all the basics you need from indica. Never lived up the hype though. Nothing extra to this, just does it’s job. Verde Natural\\'s Wedding Cake is phenomenal. \\n\\nThe high is very heavy. Be close to a couch or bed because you won\\'t want to move around too much.\\n\\nWedding Cake is one of my go-to\\'s Very heady This strain is just absolutely everything rn. I really struggle with finding strains that’ll help my fibromyalgia (most strains of actually make it worse for me), but this one is actually helping me relax and feel content and worry-free. I also feel higher than I’ve felt in at least three years and is lasting a good amount of time. This strain is that bitch This bud made me sooooo nauseous I took a pregnancy test cause it was that bad. I threw up 2 days in a row, and when I didn’t smoke it the 3rd day, I was fine. \\n\\nNow I have smoked PTSD 😩 Smokin some wedding cake as I’m typing this and the high is great. Definitely more of a Indica but not so much that I’m stuck on the couch. I just got off of work, and picked this up because my Gelato Cakes was running low. lol Grew this strain during 2020 season. I yielded a pound off one plant and her nugz are chunky with a hint of purple. Its a very resinous strain and the high is smooth in my opinion. Its intense and makes you think a lot. You do tend to get a bit sleepy and it does cause a slight paranoia if you smoke too much. Happy smoking!!! I like wedding cake but not my first pick very nice to look at smells great the high last for a while but I like cookies (all strains) Not good! As advertised. Calm. Relaxed. With a tingle all over. Add it to the ‘use again’ this. Very nice yet mellow high! I smoke this every night about an hour before. Before I would toss and turn, and stay awake thinking my favorite pair of shoes in the 4th grade to what to cook for dinner tomorrow. But smoking this had me falling asleep almost instantly! Does make me super hungry though. This is definitely my favorite strain. I have been smoking for around 14 years, & this is a strain I keep coming back to. When people ask me my most recommended strain, I tell them to try Wedding Cake. It\\'s a relaxing high, yet you can still have energy to do things like video games, or even baking (not yourself, I mean actual food) if you find that relaxing. You\\'re not glued to the couch. It made me giggly & happy, as well as less anxious. I use weed as a way to cope with my horrible anxiety disorder as well as depression. If you have any mild physical pain, this helps relax it away; or you can just get so giggly & talkative that you forget that you were in pain at all. \\nOverall, this strain is definitely a 10/10 for me. I hope those who try it also love it. Sedating without being depressing...really a standout enjoyable strain. I missed highs like this And friend and I shared a bowl then went for an appetizer. I felt good and zero paranoid feelings of being high in public. Delicious! Sweet and alot like GSC. Will send you straight to space hell, so find somewhere cosey to sit. Loved getting high enough after 2-3 hits. Tastes great and refreshing. Good for social situations. Great combination of body and head high for relaxation and creative thinking. One of my favorites. I purchased a oz of this medicine and it did wonders for my body mind and soul. Definitely recommended Love this strain!  Very smooth mellow clouds using Volcano Hybrid.  Initially a creeper, then the body begins to decompress as it sets in.  Nice horny high so it’s great with your favorite partner, partners, or yourself.  Close your eyes and enjoy the ride as euphoria and arousal sets in. I just got this strain recently.  It has help me to focus and stay in the zone while I edit! As of now it’s my #1 Love this strain! If I’m in the mood to get things done or be around people, I can burn through a bowl and go about my day with a calm, yet uplifted feeling. If I burn through a j or two, I’m in the mood to hit the sheets for a mostly uninterrupted sleep. As someone who works night shift, this strain is great in my opinion! yo i had to hop tf on here right quick to write my first review ... first off i’m currently floating on my bed high off my rocker on this sweet sweet purple wedding cake flower. my whole entire body feels like it’s getting a shiatsu massage. deadass.\\n\\nthis is by far my new #1 strain. good strain for the daily dudes.\\n\\npeace and blessings community🙏🏽 great tangy earthly flavor, smooth to smoke as well. relaxing feel and quite strong with high THC levels. Quite strong strain picked it up from “Debbies Phoenix”    Grow = Mohave cannabis (Batch # 1676)\\n\\n• 8.5/10 points VERY pungent smell, right away the stink is wow. If that’s not enough, the structure is dense with lots of tricromes. Mine came in a nice glass jar. This pot stinks so good, expect a  high THC content with this one. Not too peppery on the exhale, if you find a Seed you are a lucky duck🦆!  The genetics of this strain in particular came from “seed junkie genetics” which is where Mojave gets most of their genetics from. I am a huge, huge fan of Mojave because of “seed junkie genetics” you get what you pay for. God does it stink this is why I started writing this review. Cheers!\\n\\n •will be attempting to grow this strong stuff in Phoenix this February 2021 nice high. very happy feeling Great smooth hit with amazing flavor Smooth peppery exhale after bong hit of Wedding Cake left me feeling calm and happy w/bouts of giggling. A heightening of pleasure with the trippy tunes I\\'m chillin with Wedding cake is for lovers 🎂 ❤ My new favorite! I love happy giggly strains and this is exactly that! One of the most amazing strains I\\'ve ever taste, the perfect amount of emotion and relax!!! this is one of two my favorite strains i enjoy the feeling of euphoric  cerebral restful high I love Wedding Cake!! After ripping a few hits from my bowl, I feel like a boss ass bitch. I am instantly relaxed and calm. The downside is that my eyes get super red and my mouth gets super dry. I had some of my friends try it and they also loved it. Its smooth and tastes sweet like cake. My friend had to go to urgent care The perfect high for a relaxed night in. Initially it doesn’t kick in for a few minutes but then you’re off to the races.  I felt like cloud nine was trying to reach me as I laid there with a smile from ear to ear. I was relaxed and my anxiety melted like butter. Wedding Cake is a strain to definitely try if you haven’t. i’m straight up sautéed rn. i can really feel the terpenes in the weed. after i do something active i can fell the indica calling Part way through my second joint and the peppery flavor hangs on for a while. The kick is pretty fast and lasts for 20 to 30 minutes before I feel the need to keep it going. Couch lock tends to short lived. WC is a good strain for relaxing. Every time I try a cake strain I\\'m happy. This relaxed me, and helped with pain, nausea, and indigestion from my CRPS. Other favorites include Ice Cream Cake & Lava Cake. Good luck fellow warriors. Wow wow \\nWhat a smoke got this from my guy Magic/Kenny in glasgow lovely buds and an amazing smell and what a smoke \\n5 star ⭐️ Its one of my favorite next to ice cream cake..it help me relax when im producing music on my fl studio 20..but yea its potency is litty.. This Eugreen Farms Wedding Cake I bought tasted incredible out of the Pax 3! It tasted like drinking warm sweet cream with all the same funky after flavors as smoking the Wedding Cake. Highly recommend this strain and out of the Pax Same vain as GG and similar, if you like Gorilla Glue you’ll love this. very tasty strain, not a harsh hit. beautiful  flower, great high. A smoke at home  only though, gives you a nice \"couch lock\" Extremely hard to smoke. But extremely worth it Sweet aftertaste. I haven’t smoked in a long time and a friend gave me some of this. I didn’t get anxious or paranoid at all which is awesome for me based on past experiences. I only took four little hits and had a great time. This is a particularly \"advanced\" strain that when you consume it, untill you\\'ve gotten to used to it\\'s potency, you would do well by enjoying it\\'s full potency, one puff at a time.😎🤞 This is seriously one of my favorite strains! I make edibles with it in my magic butter machine and I usually mix this with Arizona Fire strain and it gives the perfect high!!! Very happy with wedding cake, I smoked right before work the other day and the next day all I could remember is smoking then going to work and nothing after. A very good weed/cart to just sit down and relax with or functioning simple task. This strain tastes SO good. Relaxes my body, calms my nerves. Great for unwinding before bed. Solid 4.5 stars. Lemon and peppery smell. You can feel the Euphoric effects creep in through your body almost like a tingle. I felt adventurous and immediately wanted to take a walk outside and explore for a min. I felt more aware of my surroundings, like sound I noticed more, so I turned my t.v down. Smoking it indoors i feel starry eyed around light along with a sense of calm. Takes me back to smoking near the woods in Michigan, the smell is unreal. Lemon peppery scent with earthy or piney undertones. I feel more focused like I could get things done organizing or a task before it eventually lays me out to sleep. Very euphoric on this What a great ride. It’s very relaxing out the gate, but not super pressurized in the head. Great for anxiety. Helped me deal with a stressful situation today and was able to let it go within minutes vs days. About 2 hours after I was super focused and cleaned my whole house! After dinner and full belly I’m sleepy and ready to go to bed with ease. I will say I get a lot of the herbal and peppery flavor and 0 cake flavor at all. Not my favorite taste wise. This strain is perfect for people with anxiety and eating issues. I smoked a bong of this beautiful dense nug and all my worries are gone. Plus I got hungry which I can never feel. This is top shelf!!! 10 mins in . Wake me when lockdown is over Beautiful looking buds great amount of thc crystals visable just with the eye light green definitely can tell its indicia dom very strong body buzz but also has you staring off into space at times lol very relaxing but very strong if u find your self uncomfortable when too stoned may not be qus made me cough like i had covid19 (too soon huh?) tried this mixed with a bit of lemon larry and i am on cloud 9. beautiful, euphoric, relaxing high Wedding Cake has the medicinal potency for chronic pain with it\\'s terpine profile, yet Harmony\\'s version needs to find the proper genetic mix with this strain\\'s cross-breeds for a better tasting strain.Timing of the proper flushing of nutrients & curing time need an adjustment. With slight adjustments, Wedding Cake will go 5 Star\\'s plus for this patient. Yes By far the my favorite stain no doubt. I love hitting this in my wax pen on the go, anywhere i want. super great taste. great for any time of the day One of my very 1st legal purchases from a legitimate high-end dispensary was Wedding Cake . This strain was perfect; even for beginners. I’ve got a high tolerance but it still worked it’s magic. The cookies taste is what really got me, but the high is also extra relaxing which is a plus. Mixed between cross genetics Cherry Pie X Girl Scout Cookies - this is definitely a strain you should attempt getting your hands on. Once you do, you won’t regret it. Yum!! Best piece of cake I’ve ever had and works wonders for my anxiety/depression :) time to go make a pizza now ! I find the strength to be a heavy hitter. It\\'s quite smooth upon exhale I don\\'t taste any peppery taste mostly sweet and maybe sour. It definitely hits you hard and the buzz last for quite a while keeping you somewhat in a daze but also focused. I actually do enjoy taking a pain to weddings with me and the string Works quite well for those events haha. The buds are small but dense, little popcorn buds, unless that\\'s just what I got. They also smell quite pungent and sweet . Either way good hybrid for daytime and nighttime Imo. If it’s getting Wasted you’re after, “Wedding Cake” is a full 5-Star Indica Strain for many reasons.  The Buds are thick and dank with long, deep red and white hairs peppered with an outer, whitish layer of crystals.  This strain is well known for it’s high THC content, and it is a staple at many events such as “Cannabis Cup”, where it has even placed in the Top 5! Great for relaxing and for panic attacks I smoked this stuff and had MAJOR problems. I had a sever anxiety attack. My heartbeat was over 120 bpm. I had trouble breathing. I also had tingling sensations in my head. It took over 2 hours for this stuff to wear off. I almost felt like I need to go to the emergency room. Never smoking this stuff again. This is relaaaaaaxing stuff man. I feel totally dull, I don’t want to move a muscle. I don’t wanna do this if I wanna be productive. Very fiery peppery salty flavor it has tho. Good for relaxing the eyes to 10fps The power of wedding cake to make me focus on my video games it\\'s just insane, i recommend this weed if you want to be focus in a game. Not a bad smoke for the evening. Nice and relaxing. Very nice flavour profile. Nice and stoned with a strong sense of ease I think it\\'s great for the price. uplifting and afterwards couch time. very excellent high. it\\'s a very comfortable very high feeling. you don\\'t want to be blitzed all the time. just look at you very high you\\'ll enjoy it. this is giving me such an artistic brain it\\'s really making me creative AF and in just truly vibing it\\'s a very buzzy & heady high really good for stress This is one of my top 3 favorite strains so far. For me, the effects were perfect: tunes in to the present moment, feel good vibes that ease away my anxieties and worries about what is next in life. It allows me to be present and live! very calming and relaxing, probably good for aches/pains and soreness. would definitely smoke again! Weed highly productive\\nWedddibg cake I put away my groceries and thay I did not want to do in like two minutes and I’m now typing t the speed of light and it s fu king insane I love everything about this strain hits fast and hard like fucking muhammad ali definitely for the experienced Picked up 1/2 oz of some shaky nugs. Tasty vape and a nice middle ground between couch lock and overly energetic. My new favorite strain! Also the boosted sex drive is a nice bonus! Good burn 🔥 hit fast First time trying it was last night, an I love it, it had me slumped ASAP good strain for a good night sleep for sure or just to chill and relax! A+++++++++ one of the best strains out there must try it you will love it This strain makes me feel like buddha I have a medium-high tolerance and 1/3 of a preroll got me stoned! Awesome stuff. I could really taste the pepper. That could be because I don’t typically get peppery strains. Great head high with lots of motion. I am a tad dizzy, but I’m sure that’ll taper off soon. The high seemed to come on quickly, but continued to intensify for quite some time afterward! It’s the first strain I’ve had with a high like that. Super fun anticipating what’ll come next. Give her a try. You won’t be displeased. Newbs, take it easy! You’ll get knocked off your gourd as the high continually intensifies. This strain had to grow on me a bit. At first, I wasn’t super impressed but the more I tried it, I started to understand why people like it. I felt very calm and happy and definitely euphoric. Relaxed but no couch lock. I wish it did more on the pain relief front but I definitely felt like all my stresses from the day melted away on this strain. My 2nd favorite strain, only behind Blue Dream.  Yo... my whole body feels like it’s being massaged by millions of little hands. I can feel hands massaging my head (on my shoulders). I feel like I’m at the worlds greatest massage parlor. I feel so good. Definite head high. Been about 35 min now, and I feel wonderful. I’m not sleepy tired, but I am relaxed enough that I could fall asleep. Don’t have munchies either. Just feel so chill. Mahalo One of my favs - the flavor is the best by far. Nice and sticky too, perfect for rolling. A very beautiful strain. I recently had this on our new episode of The Good Budz Podcast (streaming on Spotify, Youtube, Anchor, and more). It was an amazing tangy, herbal scent that had a smooth, cool hit to it. Solid crystallization all around. A very calming, euphoric body high with good head rush at first, that mellows to a relaxing, stress reliving buzz. Would get this instead of an actual wedding cake. Its probably cheaper by weight too. Cant beat this for the price! I\\'ve been searching for a good high and decided to try this wedding cake out. Holy hell, it was amazing. 10/10 highly recommend. Definitely a creeper. Slowly brings you to a mellow state. Great for a smooth start to your day or a nice wind down for the night. It hits you like a bus, but in a good way. I had this strain. Specifically swooped it up because they said it was Tru Infusion it\\'s even says on here in Leafly. Clearly says Tru Infusion Wedding cake so got two 8ts now the other day I tried to get more and they tell me it\\'s actually Copperstate farms. I\\'m like y\\'all can\\'t play games like that so I\\'m confused cause today it still says Tru Infusion. Was nice for the price n Tru infusion no jar tho taste like Tru infusion growers. Found a premie seed also but still good for the rate. But who\\'s the grower tho? Legit?????🤔👀 Probably some of the best weeding cake flower I’ve ever had. It had the familiar sweet creamy minty fresh smell but with an extra touch of gas. Honestly not a fan of wedding cake smell but this is one of the more gassier cuts I’ve had so I took a chance and I’m glad I did. This flower straight kicks you in the dick. Super heavy head feeling that settles into the body. It can’t have pretty intense sedative qualities but not too crazy on the munchies though. Taste was sweet and piney but not overtly so. Not all hype strains are created equal be wedding cake definitely has earned its place in the annals of cannabis history. As an occasionnal smoker, this is probably my favorite one so far. Very well balanced. If you enjoy non-stonned effects, this is one for you. You won\\'t be too overboard with energy, you will be in the zonee. Creative and happy, relaxed as well. love the high from this interesting flavor strain. I feel like if I smoke baby bowls it’s strong enough to make me feel all the good effects. But if I try to smoke a normal size bowl I get slightly paranoid I start feeling like I can breath but it doesn’t last too long and the euphoria of it pulls me in and out of the paranoia. So over all this strain is really satisfying if not abused it also helps me focus better at work when dosed very lightly. Take caution if you are not a heavy smoker!!! Helped with my coffee gastritis and relaxed me all. For  some reason this weed gave me a headache. I don’t know if it’s because it has more sativa in it or what but I cannot have this in my system. I am already prone to migraines so this just wasn’t a good one which is weird because I like ice cream cake which is a combination of gelato and wedding cake. So I am giving this batch away. Sira naturals .. Got this from a VeriLife dispensary outside Chicago, IL. Very good high. Hit pretty smooth, even from cones/joints, or blunts (King Palms, Swishers, and High Hemp). Was decent in glass as well. Really good, long lasting high. Gets me going before putting me right to sleep. Very relaxing. Flavorful and calming. It\\'s a strain that allows you to focus and fight fatigue of the daily grind. This review is based upon a Wedding Cake distillate: a very interesting flavor profile, almost like a tangy or sour French vanilla buttered creme aged in oak, which means Wedding Cake clearly tastes like a chardonnay.  After about vaporizing my distillate off and on for about thirty-five minutes, my anxious mood received a very pleasant uplifting where minutes later, I felt quite irie but not euphoric.  I sat on my porch taking in the sunset and noticed how the trees and the cars parked on the street seemed to be very intensely drawn, so I did experience the \"high-definition\" often associated with this strain, apparently.  About an hour after I stopped consuming, as the high begins to now fade, I feel a mellowing out somatically and psychologically and am thankful; and ah, here comes those sleepy bugs tugging at my eye lids.  But, some slight paranoia yet nothing too crazy; some slight dry mouth; slight munchies all about thirty minutes ago. Heavy feeling, was very nice and strong! Smell wasn\\'t as nice as the feeling it produced so don\\'t be deceived! It\\'s awesome, I\\'ll be getting more for sure! Great Panic attacks. Smoking Wedding Cake initiated a surprise therapy session that I didn’t expect to have . Going through a complicated break up from an almost decade long intense relationship atm  - 10 minutes after the first  2 inhales I started to feel more centred, and was easily able to breath into and release the various strains of tension I could feel in my body. Instant recognition and effective release  of the underlying guilt/emotional stress/ built up anxiety in my muscle memory. Wedding Cake helped me effectively release the pathos circulating in my body and mind, cathartically culminating in shedding a few tears (something I find almost impossible to do generally, and frankly didn’t think I needed until it happened). Waking up today I feel so much lighter, less tense/angry. Great strain , also a visual and auditory delight. The perfect daytime Indica, for me at least! The smell, and taste of wedding cake blows me away. The after taste of a toke is savory, and delicious. Very relaxing. The indica roots show its dominance when smoked and leaves you giggly, talkative, and hungry with the munchies. Wedding cake is for sure and all-time favorites not only does it make me very relaxed and euphoric it makes all your stress melt away WARNING: This strain is no joke, I would not recommend if you’re a beginner. Very potent hybrid, can be mildly psychedelic, making you energized if social or totally transcendent if alone. Would recommend smoking later in the day, but can be earlier I recommend caution with this strain. Hard throat hit, okay flavor, solid high, but for some reason me and my wife had severe after effects. We got about 1/2 oz, hearing that this was a great strain, and it was for a day or two! But after that, we both suffered severe mood instability and depression for about a week. We never touched Wedding Cake again. I gave 2 stars because it was a good high. Personally, I’d give this strain a 1/10. Keep in mind, it could just be the way our brains reacted after smoking this and isn’t necessarily the same story for everyone. Wedding cake is my favorite strain. It smokes good taste good. Love it 🔥🔥🔥 It’s fantastic! Great recommendation for new or veteran smokers , great smell & tasty flavor . Venom extracts go all in it when it comes to their concentrates. This is by far my FAVORITE strain!!! Within a few puffs, you begin to feel calm, relaxed, euphoric, and AROUSED! This is a great strain to help get in “the mood”. I’ve had some of the BEST SEX EVER with the help of this strain. This is the only strain that I keep in my collection. The others I buy at random. My husband and I LOVE it! You won’t be disappointed! Enjoy and have fun!! Really nice strain to smoke on a sunday night by the bed w/ your girl and watching a movie.\\nReally chill and strong taste. Remarkable strain This is one of my favorites. It does everything Leafly says it does, they took the words right out of my mouth! Perfect Hybrid for a known Indica chick! :) fucking great, tasty as hell to smoke and makes me really horny. definitely one of my favorites Wedding Cake is one of my Top 10 strains.. I have a very high tolerance however smoking just a blunt you feel that back in the day stoned feeling < yall know what I mean> ! also very good for aromatherapy for those who cant smoke! agin def top 10 strain! one of my favorites, I love doing huge hoots of my dab rig gives me one of the best highs. you can sleep instantly if you want but it doesn\\'t make you feel like you need to sleep. I\\'ve also never gotten sick off of it, no matter how much I smoke at once. Yummmmuyyuummmmmmmmmmijusthadsome!!! I love it.  It\\'s perfect for day time use. I\\'m calm, but focused and energized.  Love yo mjnds that came up with ty his strain. I just tried it for the first time.  I was very glad that I got this strain.  It blew my mind... Literally.  Great for pain relief and insomnia.  But use with caution because of the high thc content. It’s great for those who usually have anxiety and paranoia with most strains. It’s the only strain that I’ve found that doesn’t give me personally any anxiety or paranoia. Due to the extremely high THC, this strain can have a mildly hallucinogenic affect. Visual perception and sense of reality can slightly shift, if smoking for prolonged periods. I like the fact that I can be uplifted but super chill at the same time! No complaints here!!AlwayzRize!! I love this strain! A classic and wow does it jump start sex drive wow!! Wedding cake is wedding sex!! taste is good, get more May be my favorite strain! I find it to be a little indica heavy but definitely feel the Sativa side too. Really stoned and no couchlock! I can personally smoke it during day but I have a high tolerance. Very potent stuff!!!! This is one of my favorites, very relaxing yet uplifting at the same time. Very relaxing and soothing high. A lovely way to end the day and drift off to sleep. great strong hybrid. best of both worlds but this specific bud is liiiitle sativa dom. happy, uplifting, tingly, and very mentally relaxed. tingly body effects without sedation! euphoric in the right conditions and even eases into muscle relaxation. smells of a tropical and grapefruit scent primarily! Highly calming vibes This is one amazing strain...3 puffs in, I’m totally relaxed and limbs feel nice and heavy. This is a new favorite for me! I think it\\'s very peppery with a little bit of a citrus taste to it. the high is fast acting and lasts a good while, very relaxing body and head high. doesnt taste like cake but a very good strain Amazing, I personally really really enjoy this strain, it never fails to uplift you, it genuinely puts your everyday emotions to the surface, and makes you see the world for what it is and meant for. Definitely one of my top ten! Has a smooth earthy yet bright taste and is perfect for unwinding after a long day at work. A little but goes a long way which also makes it more cost effective. Taste and smells amazing. Like a fresh baked cake. This strain brought me out of my chair and got me laughing and talking with my buddies. Definitely and uplifting strain for the daytime. Not a bad strain, this is my 2nd bag of it. I’ve had a lot better but a lot worse too. gave it a reasonable 3 Beautiful, smelly and just a perfect desert Giggly and light munchies Wedding is perfect for an all day smoke. Flavorful and Pungent,the mind/body effects are both a 4-5! Definitely one of my top five strains. Wedding Cake    THC 27.45   4/3/20   Cultivator: Verano\\na.k.a. Pink Cookies. World Class. A strong lasting high that is primarily relaxing with abundant terpenes and great taste. The aroma shows blue fruits with some sweetness, and is somewhat peppery. The taste is similar, blue fruitiness with a smooth “cookie” finish with hints of vanilla.  Perfectly cured, with dense buds. Despite the high THC, it can have an overall uplifting effect, but at high doses, it may have the opposite effect.  \\nTaste:9  Aroma:8.5  Bud Quality/Curing:10 Terpene Notes 9  High: 9.5  Rating: 94/100\\n\\nStrain notes: (Cherry Pie x GSC). Indica dominant. Purported terpenes: Caryophyllene, Myrcene, Humulene  (present product not sampled). Reviewed by Illinoiscannabisreview@gmail.com I thought I was married for a minute. I live with chronic pain and use a lot of weed to help relieve it. However everytime i smoke wedding cake it’s like my first high all over again! Additionally against my ED, wedding cake brings my hunger to life! 10/10 recommended Jumped at the chance to try this strain, and I’m glad I did!  The euphoria is amazing, and the full body relaxation after that first hit is unparalleled. \\n\\nDon’t think, just buy it. One of my favorites as it\\'s sweet tasting but still has the Kush funk undertones. Mostly cerebral for me but it has just enough Indica effects to relax my body and stay focused. Perfect for getting in the flow playing your musical instrument. Classic dessert strain in terms of spicy sweet taste and calming euphoria. High potency and effective for treating pain, stress, anxiety & depression, as well as putting a smile on your face. Nice relaxing hybrid without being too sedating! it\\'s cool , I may smoke it when I\\'m feeling depressed or down bout somthing that happened years ago , but this is a beautiful strain ! Grade A. Very good and tasty buds. I took huge bong rips with ice and I feel like a slice of butter on a big ol pile of flapjacks This strain is freaking phenomenal for chronic pain and inflammation! I get the best relief ever with this. this is my absolute favorite 💖💖💖 One of my favorites. Helps with nausea and stress. if I\\'m feeling sick this is the first strain I want to smoke. Also helps wjth anxiety. Amen Amen. This strain is the most amazing high I’ve felt in a long time. I can’t explain it. Because the high is like gsc but it’s so fucking euphoric and relaxing. 10/10 Good looking buds with a sweet, fruity, and earthy smell/taste. I smoked a bowl pack of it in the afternoon, and watched some Midnight Gospel. I felt like very relaxed but also more focused on the show. In the evening I smoked a blunt of it, and watched American Ultra. Once again I felt relaxed and more focused on the movie, and thankfully even a little sleepy right before bed. Overall I really enjoy this strain, and its one of the better ones I\\'ve smoked. Amazing strain, my first time. Norwegian growth🤩 Haagen-Dazs Mango Sorbet\\nReally tingles you’re senses after smoking this strain. Whistle also watching Matilda. solid table ipa I felt like I was in 5 movies When I had Wedding Cake I literally was STUCK. Very relaxing smoke , has a cake like taste with a sweet smell. Very healthy nugs and broke down very well. I tried this strain for the first time as a concentrate by Select. The taste is very dry and earthy. I found it a bit harsh but shorter, smaller hits takes care of that. I really like the effect. Indica leaning, kinda mellow but not overpowering. No anxiety. Similar effect as Gelato or Gorilla Glue concentrates by KIND. This is the first strain I’ve found in 10+ years smoking weed that actually makes me ENERGIZED. I can smoke it and happily run around doing chores. Love it. This makes me feel numb and very fidgety. I am laughing so hard. My neck hurts but it’s not from weed hahaha. Anyways, it tastes really good to me. Makes me want chocolate. Alrighty bye. First time having this. I love it.\\nI feel high after 10 mins. Recommend this after a long day. Whoa! Smooth and even. I’m terrible with flavors. Tastes like weed to me, but on the smoother side. Very resiny but that’s due (I presume) to the very high THC content. This batch assayed at 32% and change THC. Pretty potent. \\n\\nTo wit, smoke a bowl of this stuff and you *will* see Jesus and all 12 apostles. Make sure your stereo is working because you will have an insatiable desire to listen to Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, and The Doors. Hide your car keys because you will want Tacos and a milkshake. (Don’t drive stoned. Use Uber Eats). \\n\\nOn the other hand, if you are alone and have no booty to call, have PornHub and whatever toys you want at the ready. You’ll need them. \\n\\nI give this strain a 5 bong rating. With this strain, I personally believe that it is equal to if not greater than GSC. And I mean on terms of the effectiveness of how it gets you high for inhalation. It gives me a very good head high. One blunt of this and I am high for a good while. It makes me feel loose and untangled. I feel that I can smoke wedding cake at any time of the day or night and I’ll be able to work perfectly fine or do any activities. Or I’ll be able to sleep well. Last night I smoked for the first time in 10 years due to me being in the military.. I rolled a joint as best as I could remember how to do it, like when I was back in high school.. anyways I sat out on the porch while it was raining heavy.. I could not begin to remember the last time I felt so relaxed and had not had a care in the world.. my anxiety, ptsd, every thing just went away. Really great relaxing yet energizing head high, i found it really just clears my mind and can help me actually focus on things that need to get done. Amazing strain Freshhhh Fresh One of my new favorites, super stoney. Great taste and flavor, reminds me of the OG. great bright flavor. Definitely pick up the citrus notes. great green color and lightly dusted by keif. This strain was one of the best I\\'ve ever had and as a rap artist I would say out of all the wedding cake buds I\\'ve gotten....Hands Down Verano\\'s Wedding Cake Grade A Reserve is the best and you get a good amount for the price too. Minty, diesel and sweet all at the same time. Reminds me of blackberry kush. Really like it. No sleepy, no headache. Perfect. I have had black market quality wedding cake, but never from a dispensary. I was able to buy some at the dispensary and, wow! It\\'s a nice euphoric strain that can comfortably be your side companion on a bit of a self-exploration smoke sesh. I really enjoy this strain. I’ve had it in flower and sugar - very good for inflammation and chronic pain for me. Also helps with anxiety more than depression for me, but I also experience higher anxiety fluctuations compared to depression. I ate my wedding cake mushed up in pink cookie dough. Yup, this good no matter which name you call it. It elevates my mind and causes much bellyachin\\'. Its up for a while then gives me that Cheshire cat grin and I get warm and doze between sleep and awake until sleep wins. Incredibly smooth. My reactions  to things were a bit slower.l reflex wise. Can really feel the high in my head. Good notes of citrus and you can catch the pepper near the end. A strain that makes you feel like nothing else matters I was gifted a few grams of this from a childhood friend.  I love the way this tastes-very citrusy, my favorite.  This strain has been my go-to,  vaporized in my firefly 2+ after a long day of work.  I’m more of a medical marijuana pt and stay away from strains that make me feel paranoid or give me anxiety and wedding cake never made me feel that way. One of my absolute favorite strands definitely would recommend to anyone for any time. Got me very high and tastes and smells amazing! It’s one of the better ones to help with my nausea and get me interested in food again. It’s one of my favorites because I can solve my problem with eating AND lessen my anxiety AND have fun with it. Sometimes I have to pick a strong indica to help me and then I want to sleep all day. If I’m already tired this strain puts me on my @ss, but if not I can relax and enjoy the high. I don’t get much that done with it, probably because it’s so spacey and relaxing. wedding cake / pink cookies (Humboldt farms) my favorite or second favorite arousal strain. Liked it more than Sour Diesel probably because it\\'s more balanced. Good euphoria, relaxation, full body tingles, fairly intense high, sensitive touch almost like a 50/50 hybrid even though it\\'s indica dom. one of the smelliest and stickiest flower that I have tried to date; hits really deep in my upper mouth lower nasal cavity.  it\\'s hella skunky and I got immediate complaints upon opening the jar. taste like peppery skunk meat and burnt rubber. if the high and benefits were not worth, I would not be rating it this high. Excellent tasting ~ you will immediately feel the effects, this is strong stuff! Loved this strain, thats really all I got to say lol. Get ahold of some from your local dispensary or independent supplier and see for yourself! One of my top 10 favorite strains hands down One of my favorites! Super relaxing this strain is amazing. great relaxing effects and an amazing smooth taste. highly recommend for anxiety and stress relief! Positive deals Didn’t like it. Too leafy. I am a big fan of all the cookies and cake strains, as they are all great hybrids that I can depend on to help with chronic stomach issues, anxiety, PTSD and depression. Wedding Cake is such a great versatile hybrid, I can enjoy it any time of day or night. It\\'s also good for boosting libido if you deal with the unfortunate side effects of antidepressants or other meds that might cause problems with that issue. The limonene dominance in this strain makes it a great mood enhancer and can help you feel energised and relaxed at the same time, really one the best kinds of hybrid strains on the market. One of my favorites!! Makes me so mellow and is amazing when helping with anxiety Actually tastes like cake, real mellow vibes. Im a daily smoker and this one hit me pretty hard, I was kinda out of it actually. Had me pretty spacey. The euphoria outlasts that of other buds, great if you\\'re looking for a strong morning buzz or going to sleep. Haven\\'t slept that good in a while to be honest. One of the best stains for sure. Amazing strain, very relaxing. you\\'re gonna need some munchies for this one! it has become easily my favorite Super relaxing, perfect for schlumping at the end of the day but you’re still functional enough to stay awake and enjoy your end-of-day sesh. I like to think of this strain as a great “decompressor”. If there\\'s a problem, it might get solved. A nice tasting flower and relaxing high This is an amazing strain with a ton of medicinal properties (terpines) with HIGH THC.. Pain is almost.. gone... I usually can never get my pain under 5.IAfter a half gram . I can say my pain is a 4.. Wonderful.. I\\'m actually & literally floored.!!\\nLong story short, I\\'ve had lots of surgeries & now alot of nerve & bone damage plus my left leg from middle thigh down is all metal. On top of the mental issues Anxiety, ect.\\nSo my friend Julie & Justina told me u have to try it. Well Holy Shit Sherlock.!! This is (so far) by far the best Flowers I\\'ve used.. My tolerance is so friggin high from all those what I call Kill Pills. The high THC & perfect amount of CBD this Hybrid is so strong, I love it. In fact the first time I popped in a Nug it was so good (everything about it, smell,taste(OMG!) that I had to burn up another nug. That was the end of my day.! Period!! I very soon found out how potent this flower really was. I\\'ve since harnessed it\\'s power to 1 1/2 buds per session or I\\'m toast.! LOL ! 😙💨💨I hope this combo of strains & grower keep this one alive. I will Always get Wedding Cake when it\\'s available. Can\\'t say enough. \\nLove u guyz @ Harmony!!⚘💞😊🤙 Happy should be a 10 for this. So happy it made me cry. Thought it would be just a coincidence,  but for the last 7 nights strait, it just keeps hitting me with extreme happiness.  Ended up calling everyone that would answer my video calls...lol. let see what tonight brings. Amazing hybrid strain!! I picked up an 1/8 from my dealer and told me he Highly reccomend this lol couch lock with tingly feeling for sure. Also with a taste of vanilla and citrus! Good Made me higher than I’ve been in like a ton of 10 of 10 days Halfway through a joint that’s about a gram and I am lit. This hasn’t happened in a long time and I smoke every single night. If you see this get it. It’s a real feel good high too. I don’t know if it’s named Wedding Cake because it’s tasty or because it makes you so horny your going to be like on your wedding night.  \\n\\nI didn’t read any of the reviews to put preconceived notions in my head prior to really noticing the effects of this strain.   And  of the hundreds of strains I’ve smoked, this is honestly the only one that has had this particular effect on me.   Got to be Mother Nature’s private Viagra...it’s a beast in the bedroom folks. Really helps with anxiety and insomnia. This strain makes you extremely relaxed. Fantastic mood-boaster. Good day-time strain and medication for anxiety/stress. It\\'s been a long time since I felt this good from a strain. A little more on the expensive side, but it\\'s well worth the investment. Makes me feel a very strong sense of euphoria. Tried wedding cake for the first time last night and I am loving it. I can think clearly and I’m so relaxed that my back pain has eased up to the point I can move and get things done. amazing one of my favs fs. smoking thus out of a pipe hurts a bit but becomes incredibly smooth after and leaves a really good taste in your throat that taste sweet and feels so smooth. definitely a bit more of a sativa feel with this i was very happy and did a lot of laughing so far so good smoke a little played some Minecraft, smoked while playing then got off to play with my make up, just got a new pallet wanted to experiment. smoked a bit again now im laying down i feel good but i want food lol. ill update if something bad happens :) It\\'s a very calming strain without making me feel like a potato. so good and good flavor It’s calming yet your able to stay focused when needed. The flavors are peppery, and a dry citrus taste some herbal smell.\\nIt’s a good hybrid for those who already hyper and need to tone it down a bit.\\nSome may prefer indica with ADHD, but for people like me who already calm but need some inspiration to better the mood, I’d go with the Wedding Cake hybrid Normal good indica I tried this strain for the first time this week and I have been presently surprised by it’s effects. The high comes pretty quick and packs a punch. The feeling is very relaxed and leaves me in touch with my surroundings. I enjoyed this outside on my porch and was very occupied by the birds and other elements of nature this morning. Really blissful and definitely gets the job done. Tastes like cake, super calming I got this at euphoria in tulsa ok and ot sucks. it doesn\\'t look anything like the picture. and it\\'s full of seeds. nice compressed bud that broke down well. Smoke wasn\\'t harsh but smooth and had a mellow taste. I\\'ve always loved wedding cake, and I can pretty much always count on a strain being great if it has the word cake in its name. for example, I just picked up some East Cake (Sour Diesel × Wedding Cake) and it\\'s easily some of the best smoke I\\'ve ever had. that said, it\\'s still not QUITE as good as its parent strains each are alone, it is very good. Wedding Cake is such a heavy smoke, it keeps you feeling relaxed all throughout your body for hours. it\\'s great for back pain, and if you want to sleep on it, you can quite easily, and you\\'ll sleep very well. The taste is really nice in a bong. Kind of heavy smoke but the high feels nice. Relaxed mostly for me but I was able to still clock in some lyrics in the studio Well hello libido. I love this strain! It helps with pain and sleep. I get one with high THC from Verano. Definitely one of my top favorites. This one has become a go-to for me. It seems to offer the energy and creativity of a sativa with the euphoria and tingle of an indica. Discovered it today and it’s my absolute favorite already! Most strains give me terrible anxiety but this one actually gets rid of it! Wow! Just WOW! I would say this is a very relaxing strain but it does hit hard and fast. I smoked this in a 1 gram joint and by the time I was done I was literally drooling on myself. I highly recommend smoking this right before you go to bed. This strain is certainly one of the tastiest bud ive ever smoked. Smoked a joint while hiking and omg. The high is amazing. Enhanced my smell and my vision was heightened as well. Very good strain ive had a few carts of wedding cake and its honestly the perfect balance. its one of my top favorite strains for sure and im honestly kinda eager to try some wedding cake flower sometime soon I absolutely love this strain. It is best to use in the evening when I am no longer needed to go anywhere or drive. I can relax it helps my pain and I can rest easy. I do enjoy the giggles that it gives me and the silliness. And it also gives me an appetite. Nothing but good things about this. This $h!+  makes you feel that 60 % water you are made of. Picked up a strain called “Wedding Cake” yesterday and woo wee... yeah woo wee.. lol.. I packed a good sized bowl and turned on “White House down” the movie is over 2 hours long so I figured I’d stay up to watch it, I took a good couple tokes from the bowl... I made it through about 1 hour of the movie then all I couldn’t take the sleepiness anymore. I even left the TV on.. rolled over and slept on the couch lol. Strongly recommend for a veteran smoker because this one will over power you.. #NighttimeOnly This shit will put you on yo ass I have the giggles, ha...and definitely dry mouth. Uplifting. Calming. Mellow. Found a 27.68thc off this here and man I’m delighted w joy I was instantly relaxed , one of my new favorites! I think everyone needs to try Wedding Cake Amazing Delightful smoke. 😋 Cherry Pie + GSC is a perfect combo! Lifted my mood and gave me the munchies! Smells great! Had a great flavor, but low tolerance personal be warned. Your gonna need a pillow. Very very dank strain. ok, this is now my new strain. I bought it at the Gas Station in Midwest City, OK for $14 on their Platinum shelf. I had one hit and I Was high for a WHILE. It gives a GREAT night’s sleep & helps with pain. I would recommend this strain to anyone trying to get a good nights rest. Feel very very relaxed, but at the same time Energetic!! Also i am high as fuck! Wooo! good stuff Very nice one I\\'ve only been smoking for barely 2 months but I\\'ve tried a handful of strains and this has been my favorite. Only took a few hits and I was good for the night. I felt like I\\'d been watching the world through a TV screen and I was only just now fully interacting with the world around me. It\\'s not the first one to give me this feeling but it\\'s been the strongest. I felt like I could see my individual thoughts and emotions, and how they interacted, so clearly now that they weren\\'t all tangled together. I went to sleep and woke up in the middle of the night euphoric even thought I could feel the high wearing off. I laid there awake, not worried about falling asleep or getting out of bed, just feeling completely satisfied and at peace like this was right where I belonged and where I wanted to be. One of my favorite strains for bed. Taste amazing the terp profile in this strain taste amazing for any use of consumption As a novice user I’m surprised the bud tender suggested this. I’m glad I bought a CBD tincture to balance it out because it’s really strong The description doesn\\'t even cut it, this strains firrrrrrreeeee bruh!!!!  Literally imagine eating a tic tac for only three seconds. that first three seconds taste like sweet vanilla and cherry. my dude get you some of this. pain cut down and feeling great. you\\'ll love it Favorite strain. I have anxiety disorder and Wedding Cake strips me of all anxiety.  I am relaxed, giggly and calm. Doesn’t put me to sleep like GDP or bubba kush. Favorite strain so far. Used a herb vaporizer, very tasty. Great head high, case of the giggles, and the creative wheels were rolling. Zero paranoia. I Love this strain! It packs punch but it doesn’t make me paranoid. I have anxiety and this strain mellows me out. A sweet tasting, potent long lasting It was ok overall. Gave me the itchy and allergy side effects like crazy though. Got this one from Okl. amazing, relaxed body high with a hint of stoned plus the taste of sweet vanilla icing-- perfect!!! My top strain hands down! I’ve tried 🎂 from several growers/brands and I have loved them all! 🔥 will put me on my ass but i will want to go to bed asap. not good for getting work done or productivity of any kind. I feel so happy, yet relaxed. Calms my ulcerative colitis too. Helps make the pain go away. Will smoke again One of the best strains of cookie you can get. It taste like thin mint GSC and has vanilla but earthy gassy sweet peppery taste to it this strain will have you taste buds go crazy there\\'s so many different flavors of good weed in here you gotta love it thw high is long lasting all around body and mind great strain for anything from sleeping to going to work Yummy flavor, smooth, very good head high. Really nice smoke. It smells better than it tastes but it does taste nice. Helps a lot of pain and helped me to relax. So, this strain is a really good option if you want yo stay in between chill and awake. I have palpitations problems because a heart prolapse I have. This strain cause nothing of that on me, I felt the high but I wasn’t sleepy. I like this strain to because I smoke at night so I can sleep but the hunger some strains give is unbearable this one not so much. Makes my heart feel like it’s being dipped in Gold. A1 Gas Be warned! This strain kicks like a mule! Tastes great, really smooth smoke and really sticky buds with amazing colours. Very hallucinogenic too. Not for beginners! I like this strain, but I feel like it’s eh on if I’ll get a good hit or not. If I don’t rip the bong hard AF to the point where I’m coughing up lungs I don’t feel much of anything. But with that good hit I’m comfortable, focused, not feeling much like talking and I’d say it’s about time for a nap. This doesn’t give me insane munchies either, so that’s a plus. I’d definitely recommend trying this if you get the chance.\\nReflection: can feel my heartbeat in my chest and can tell when I’m breathing more prominently. Quiet but mindful. Sleepy. Relaxed. The taste is definitely a smooth sweet taste. You get really goofy/ talkative. Then next thing you know bedtime. I woke up still feeling effects of this. relaxing and almost cloud like comfort. love it. it is the bomb 👌 Gives me energy to get things done, for about an hour or two. Then I take a happy nap. \\nI wake up in a great mood. Definitely a favorite for me I love everything about it from its look to its taste. Was not disappointed in any way. Also if you guys like this I recommend you try “BEACH WEDDING” which is a cross between wedding cake and Tropicana cookies !! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 Be careful my friends. this stuff is a real creeper. I have been smoking it for insomnia and pain for a week or so now, and its the kind of stuff you smoke at 9:30 and wake up buzzed with. Great strain for when you have a few hours to kill, but you cant function on it. Good hits, bad headaches Very relaxing strain, in the best sense of the word. Feel like I could happily lie down and listen to Hiroshi Yoshimura’s Music For Nine Postcards (which you should throw on right now), or get up and reorganize my house. Either way the key here is that I’m truly relaxed and content. Love love love this strain 😻\\n\\nGettin s*** done after a joint of this\\n\\nNot to mention I couldn’t keep my hands off my man This is the closest I’ve come to finding a perfect strain. Beautiful buds that smell great and tastes even better. I’ve never smoked bud that tasted sweet like this one. A little goes a very long way, but it just makes me happy and soothes all of the tension out of my muscles. Highly recommend! 👍🏼👍🏼🎂 I love this stuff. First time smoking it, and I would definitely again. Relaxing mellow high. Perfect for lounging at home and listening to music. Highly recommend. 💜 I splurged on some live resin dabs, and boy am I happy! Lovely tasting terpy goodness. I find it relaxing and uplifting anytime of day. It\\'s got a sweet and earthy  flavor. This is my kind of high! Clean, happy, light. It\\'s kept me entertained during quarantine. It quickly became one of my favorite strains. I am not feeling depressed and it is a very delicious strain 😛 Smells cheesy and earthy with citrus undertones. After smoking the taste is much more peppery than anything else. Uplifting high. Would recommend. Wedding cake is my absolutely favorite. So calming...makes me feel happy and goofy as shit. Doesn’t make me feel like I want to eat the house, either A friend got me some of this. I don\\'t sleep much or for very long., and I don\\'t disconnect from my job in IT well. My friend had gave me other types of weed, but none helped me fall asleep and stay there as well as Wedding Cake does.\\nUsually, about an hour or so after smoking, I am relaxed and hop in the recliner. Then I\\'m out for about 5 hours of really solid sleep. Then when I move into my bed, I go back to sleep quickly and without thinking about work.\\nIf you need to unwind, this is a great bud to smoke to accomplish that. Plus, it has a great citrusy taste and doesn\\'t fowl your breath like some strains do. Even after brushing my teeth. \\nI would not drive or go to any job after smoking this strain, since it can make your attention span worthless. Which is great and why I smoke it. Your thoughts will float around. ;P Giggly and long lasting, one of the best stains I\\'ve had in a while! So good, mellow strain (my batch) it leaves you relaxed but leaves the thoughts running. decent Very good not too overwhelming mellow effect YUMMY! Got this from my local dispensary in AZ. A sweet taste that gets you in the mood! Nice and relaxing way to end the day. I  love it! the first bud to get me properly high in a very long time 😍 First we started off smoking one bowl, bringing a super strong head high and euphoria. The taste was citrus with a lemon vibe to me. Had a super sweet aftertaste as well and there was like a little bit of earthy spice. Although im relaxed and a little tired, I still feel euphoric, uplifted, and creative with a strong focus. Head high was a little overwhelming, but my tolerance is low at the moment so take that into account. Felt the strain deserved a 3.6, so I rounded it up to 4 stars because I\\'d definitely recommend this strain to people I know. This review is based off Exotikz “Real Wedding Cake,” which is supposed to be full on Indica. Flower review.\\n\\nGreat fucking strain. Super fun head high, along with pure sofa spud relaxation. It’s a stronger strain, usually at the least 18% THC, and it works great for vaping before going to bed.\\n\\nYou’ll either fall into a nice sleep, or you’ll be so high and silly that you won’t even care and you’ll relax anyway.\\nExcellent for night time use. Definitely plan on buying this again. Excellent strain. Strong, perfectly balanced hybrid. Made me smile without even trying. Felt extremely relaxed. Smelled real strong. An all time favorite. Iont even smoke and tonight I smoke Wedding Cake and Gorilla Glue so I\\'m reviewing both. It\\'s been 14 years and oh mahhh Milky Way Galaxy!!!!!!! I\\'m high af. Happy, really happy and giggly like an idiot in school high again! 14 years of the heavy stuff and no blowin trees, what an experience this is! Flavor wonderful, made me feel like I was at my brother\\'s wedding all over again, definitely a good experience. Throat burns but didn\\'t cough much as I thought I would, feeling stuck in my spot but it\\'s a good stuck without a worry in the world and I\\'m watching some shit on whirlpools and quicksand and shit. Took my first hit to \"Holy Diver\" by Dio and have kept this smile on ever since. It\\'s been at least 1 hour and a half and I ain\\'t jumping off this cloud yet. Hell Yea Use this to assist with crippling anxiety. Does a great job. Helps focus too. this strain is good for unwinding after work or relaxing with friends. \\n\\na few things i’ve notice about this strain were:\\n\\n- gave me insane munchies.\\n- knocked me out for what seemed like forever but ended up being less than 2 hours every time. \\n- awoke refreshed \\n- libido booster (for me) Wedding Cake is the best!!!! after work, day off, movie/ gaming - gear. Hands down phenomenal exotic stone.  It\\'s not a bright energizing sativa. Your gonna be Thor hammer lightning strike honey smacks high. It\\'s a heavy one, your gonna love it. What is a 4 star strain?\\n Wedding Cake, came to me Black Market.\\n\\nIt was Wedding Cake, it was real, and I felt it.\\n 4 stars, means - CHASE THE DRAGON ELSEWHERE. Wedding cake 🎂 perfect for sleeping. About 15 mins after smoking I felt very relaxed, almost as if on cloud 9. Definitely a good strain if you’ve had a rough day and just want to sleep it off. I was high asf ba chillin 😎 Wedding Cake provided me with a very balanced and happy high. It feels a little too stimulating too help me sleep and a little too attention-robing to allow me to focus. It’s a nice balance but not the strongest in any one attribute. It’s the John Doe of weed. I’m never sick of it but never super interested in it as well. not a fan at all. gives you a head high but other then that its wack. I drove for 2 hours to pick this up and let me tell you it was worth it! Very dense and strong. Very smooth and sweet tasting , By far my favorite strain of weed Nice and mellow. absolute gold. SUPER smelly though Gets me super giggly and relaxed. an absolute power house for the aid of my anxiety. Great taste and touch, surrounded in a euphoric relaxed/sleepy state. Recommended to anyone dealing with any level of body discomfort or stress Love it!!! we are in the midst of a national quarantine for a pandemic level virus that’s infecting millions but i\\'m serving sexy butch lesbian in my hammer pants and tiny tank top strutting overconfidently through my abandoned town with Making Flippy Floppy in my headphones high off a joint i made out of two mini rolling papers and a trident pineapple carton An almost perfect strain! Hits hard, the high is very enjoyable. Creative and stimulating but not at all anxious or paranoid. I can go to sleep with it if I\\'m relaxed or clean the house if I\\'m not. This was SUCH a wine down kind of night strange. No anxiety or paranoid thoughts. I vaped it so i really sure about the flavor. It definitely had a slow onset. it creeped up on me and then i was like whoaaaaa i am very high! it calmed me out and made me feel like i was wrapped in a big full body hug, like those heavy weighted blanket! this is definitely a new post work favorite of me. it basically erases any kind is day you had a gives you a new relaxed, couched cozy, rose colored goggles type of feel. Mellow and a nice body and head high made cranberry juice taste bad :/ A very good strain, it takes a little bit to hit and creeps up on you. Once it hits, be prepared for maximum relaxation with some happy effects. The flower tasted and looked great, little dense light green buds. Tasted very citrusy with a hint of pepper which made for a great smoke. Would definitely reccomend picking this up if you get the chance! Amazing flavor. Great high. It got me high school high! I was trying to figure out where I was in pictures I took!! Now time to warp jump into the Rise of Skywalker 😁 Lovely strain! Right now I’m using a MuV GPen pod with this strain and it’s amazing! I’ve never been disappointed with the flower or cartridge form of this strain!!! The flavor is always consistent as well as the high! Bought a vape of wedding cake while in Vegas. Great strain and very relaxing. If you’re looking to go out and enjoy you’re day on this, think again. Great for sleeping, some munchies but overall relaxing. If you hit it hard too many times you may space a bit. Doesn’t last long. Sex is fantastic on it though. Recommend that for sure. after taking a few hits off a blunt of this, it was SMOOOOOOOOTH sailin sittin on the couch. it usually takes me a whole blunt and a half to get me THIS stoned, but let me tell ya, only took 4 hits this morning and im doin great! makes my stomach feel slightly funny but not quite queasy or unpleasant persay, but eating dont fix it. may just be this batch though. definitely recommend and will get again!!! Have had few times. it\\'s an okay hybrid but not my ideal choice I am a girl who suffers from anxiety and she helped me a lot to control it. Stoned Cold, Steve Austin. This stuff will suck you through your headphones and put you in the band. Tighten your drool strap, bucko. Must try due to its classic lineage, great for pain relief and relaxing muscles Wide-eyed, caffeinated come-on is mostly in the head and eyes. Thoughts come quicker, but never feel too speedy or uncomfortable. It’s like taking a good upper. There’s an elastic distance that mildly increases dissociation. Even though I’m feeling more distant, I don’t feel any less capable. Surprisingly high-functioning enough to be a work strain. Mood elevation mostly in the form of contentedness. More zen than emotional. Has a wry sense of humor. Wish it was more socially energetic. Music is trippy and fresh, but easily slips into the background and can take work to focus on. This is an interesting high that offers a chill experience that’s worth exploring - but, I’d opt for something with more mood elevation and better sensory accentuation. I smoked this years ago and remember it being one of the most anxious/paranoid strains I’ve ever had. I fortunately didn’t feel that while reviewing this time, but many other people warn about similar effects, so be careful if you’re emotionally unstable. Amazing! I guess I really shouldn\\'t have been surprised based on the reviews, but this strain was a real treat. It was shared among some buddies around 9pm after the kids went to bed, and it left me happy, talkative, and extremely focused and productive. I happily cleaned the house and organized the garage....around 1030 at night One of the best that I\\'ve had. If you want to be relaxed to the max go for this one. I did have a boost of wanting to be creative. Good for night time. Great high but makes me super paranoid and anxious if I\\'m not in the right setting or state of mind. But the times where I\\'ve been chill before smoking or vaping it it\\'s an awesome tingly very relaxed high. For me one of the best genetics. Triangle Mints #23 from seed junky is a fcking great creation. Terps on point, cake gass with hints of smooth sweet vanilla Fantastic!  \\nIt hit me like a freight train, I couldn\\'t stop laughing. I felt like I was in a movie 😂 it starts like that, you have to hyper focus to eat but it tastes so good. \\nThen you get uncontrollably aroused. \\nMy husband got very anxious and paranoid after that part of the high but I didn\\'t I was more relaxed. He my anxious half anyway so I believe it\\'s more of a personality reaction.  \\n\\nOverall great experience. we over served and probaly could have did two hits and been high for awhile but go big or go home am I right? I took 2 weak hits and feel relieved my from anxiety. I was scared it was gonna be to strong but it hits the spot just right for a person who can get anxiety from trying a new strain. this was one of my first strains and it was amazing. wouldn\\'t recommend it to novice smokers but veterans know what\\'s up when it comes to wedding cake. Hands down an anazing strain for veterans to even amateurs. Beware though, high doses will have you couch locked as FUCKKK!!!! This strain is just as delicious as the name, aromatic and full of flavor, smells sweet and of course you smell its amazing amazing amazinnnnggggggg parent GSC in it. overall, 10/10 the high acts almost instantly with the headchange, thoughts begin to just turn into low eyes with a smile on your face for no reason, and hey, if you have chronic pain, i PROMISE!! this will do the job, just make sure youre buying FRESH flower thats been cured right! This is definitely in my top 10!!!! This is a great strain to start out with if you’re new to cannabis. This gives a wonderful, light, and relaxed high. \\n\\nI took a few hits from my vape while I was feeling super anxious about work, and it jus lifted me up and made me relaxed. \\n\\nI do have to agree with some of the other reviews, this one is a creeper so don’t be surprised if you end higher than you thought you would. I vape Wedding cake, and it’s one of my favs.. it helps with my aniexty a lot!! seed junky created something amazing with this pheno . I\\'ve been on this strain heavy for 3 months now, the taste is what makes you wanna keep smoking but the heavy high is what gets you to put it down, the indica shines in this one with light cerebral effects reccomend for the night or heavy users Very nice level-headed and easy going high. it has a light vanilla taste with a little pepper and citrus notes, especially present exhaling through the nose at the same time as mouth. but its a straight wedding this was a great strain. a few hits in the morning and you know it’s gonna be a good day. It made me clean out a closet I haven’t touched since 2007. Amazing. Lol. I highly recommend it! Couch locked for hours and hours. It’s a nice calm high but makes my mouth super dry and makes me pretty twitchy Didn’t really have much effect. Needed to smoke a lot to feel a little bit stoned Favorite strain ever. Ive had the bud as well as multiple concentrates that were the Wedding Cake strain and it has been amazing every time. Great flavor, great hard-hitting highs, and can knock you out if you indulge at the right time. Definitely pick it up if you haven’t tried Wedding Cake. Straight up best day high.  Very calm and Sophisticated feeling almost lol, I’m a server at Olive Garden meaning it’s never ending MF! Constant back and forth hassle and frustration. Gets me ready everyday for the upcoming guaranteed bullshit:) Pretty great. I used it in a new oil pen, and it hit very hard, so I was luckily done for the night anyway, or else I would have been in trouble. Was able to stay up on it for just over an hour before having to go to bed. But that’s just because I overestimated how many puffs to take. Great head high. Only drawback was when I woke up in the middle of the night, I had very minor dry mouth and a little headache. But both were fine by the time I woke up to get ready for work. Can’t wait to hit it again. It’s strong and feels good.  It felt like 2 different experiences.  The body high was similar to a heavy indica.  It made me feel weightless but at the same time my limbs felts very heavy and large, I did not want to move.  The mental high was the exact opposite, it made my mind think... think a lot.  It’s was a very fun high but I don’t know yet if I want to rank this as a top strain for me.  I am an Indica smoker looking for a help with stress, pain and sleep.  This strain, from what I’ve experienced isn’t one of my favorite ones for sleep but because of the body high, you could probably fall asleep easily.  The body high felt with all and any pain without issue but the stress/anxiety wasn’t really helped due to the type of mental high I experienced.  I would recommend this strain if you have always wanted to try it like I have but for what I’m looking for, I pry won’t use this again.  Until I’m out of it however, I will continue to enjoy it.  It is very good. Music man, this strain makes it the best it’s ever been in a long time Friends and I smoked 3 bowls! Could barely hold the camera 🤣 This stuff is 🔥. I smoked 1/2 a joint & am fucked up. Don’t dare to walk just yet as my head is spinning atm. Have a shit eatin’ grin I can get rid of LMFAO🤣🤪😆 Def top of my cannabis list!! This strain is great for winding down. After the first hit or two I felt the calming effects. Also became more thirsty but not necessarily had the dry mouth side effect. one of the best smokes when grown and cured right!! Some of the most potent weed I have ever had! Gotta say it hits quick and it hits hard, trust me when I say your gonna feel this for a while 😤 10/10 I took 3 one hitter tokes and for some reason tried to pass the gas pump nozel to my lead carpenter \"who wasnt smokin cuz he was driving\" just looked at me and says wtf i dont want a shot of that...lmao great bud! One of my favorites for dealing with MS. Symptoms like nerve pain, urination, stress and helping with walking, meditation and exercising. A true one-hit wonder, with that OG “classic stoned” feeling, \\'nuff said! To elaborate… A very well balanced strain overall, definitely indica leaning for me but there is also a very cerebral stone that feels somewhat more like a sativa. The stone is strong with this one for sure, haven\\'t felt this stoned in a WHILE, and I\\'ve had at least 30 different strains over last year and this one is stoney-baloney, so beware! Take it slow with this girl, take a couple of hits and see how you feel, it\\'s a creeper, and the strong cerebral effects can bring on a bit of anxiety if taken in lager doses (the only downside to this strain for me).\\nFYI the genetic for Wedding Birthday Cake are (Triangle Kush x Animal Mints), the (Cherry Pie x Girl Scout Cookies) genetic belong to Birthday Cake, and yes, those two ARE different strains, however a lot of dispensaries, growers, etc use the two strain names interchangeably so there\\'s confusion on the genetics sometimes.\\nHappy toking! This is one of my favorites.  I love the flavor! This one does give tingles. My headache went away. At the same time, the stress of the long week is leaving from my shoulders. I\\'m relaxed,a bit lazy,but boy I feel happy. My Wedding Cake experiences pretty much exemplify my “moth to the flame” tendencies.  This can be scary as hell, but also be pretty amazing (at one point in my trip I got to talk to someone important to me who died a number of years ago).  Be smarter than me and tread carefully with this one. This strain is perfect for my PTSD and depression, as it just melts away my anxiety while still giving that uplifting motivation. It is perfectly sweet and tangy with that pepper and herbal background notes. I have purchased this strain in high quality to low, to concentrates and I find that this strain is rather consistent across the board through all quality. Nice happy high. Bought the wedding cake SHUGARWAX incredibly strong and amazing from Michigan by Savage Cannabis Very good I do like this one. I just smoked two bowls, shared with two other people. and I am pretty high rn. Like I can see every inch of this car. I feel so good and it’s a good melt like cole said. Luv this is lit rally the best 😳it tastes so good too really good weed for anxiety!! taste great. great smell as well. Very nice! This is definitely a great smoke for the evening. It made me feel very euphoric, light, happy. Such an amazing strain Helps with Ms fatigue and with pain :-) Sweet skunky smell right off the bat. Extremely pungent and hard to cover up! Buds are medium green with hues of purple and bright orange hairs sticking out of a field of sticky trichomes. It looks like it has been topped with powdered sugar. Smoke is like the smell, extremely pungent and it hangs around forever. This stuff will hit you like a fuggin Mack truck from nowhere! Prepare to surrender the rest of the time to sleep or gawking off into the distance while looking like a 110 year old grandfather trying to read the Sunday paper with no glasses.\\nDefinitely an extremely good strain for pain, anxiety, sleeplessness, appetite problems and general discomfort.  A go-to if you want a hard-hitting indica...be careful son, this isn\\'t your grampy\\'s weed! very calming strain. one of my favorites because it gives you just the right amount of everything! I prefer stronger Indica strains. But this has a perfect sativa-indica ratio. Great relaxation, piney n peppery taste even a lil gassy. We had 30.4% buds too. Very potent. Reccomend to Sativa or Indica lovers. A great mix of each. Hits really nice, good coloration and trichomes excellent weed for hanging out watching movies I like the way it’s flavored but it’s a kinda dark dark batch of what I have but it’s doing the job and I’m relaxing watching cartoons with kids and that’s all I need it’s just enough to make me feel like I am relaxed not about to pass out and stuff but I am smoking more now so maybe it will hahah it’s a great strain either way a night time goto hybrid Super frosty and will always guarantee a hard hitting smoke sesh. One of the most intense highs I’ve had. Quick onset. Tastes SOOO good! \\nPerfect for when i’m feeling a middle of the day nap! \\nIt puts me in a happy mood, and after my nap those happy, uplifted, feelings are still there. It’s a good feeling and the taste is so yummy! I just finished two heavenly bowls that my buddy drew and gave me. This is an absolutely beautiful relaxed high that is just great for melting away stress and anxiety. It was wildly tasty with different notes each hit some of the really distinct notes were a spicy floral, very peppery note, and the grapfruity-rosemaryish flavor were very bold on most exhales. Very pleased with Wedding Cake. Omg I couldn\\'t believe it when I found this strain in an affordable shatter! I\\'ve heard such good things about this strain that I knew I had to try it. Took 2 intense hits & woah! Now I am pleasantly blessed by this holy union lol. One of my new favorites hands down! Wedding cake by flow kana has a Sweet danky smell. \\nMy bud came from Angry Bunny Ranch of Mendocino county in a gram container with thc at 21.59% and .05% CBD \\nTastes as sweet as it smells. Not harsh, at all. \\nI experienced a relatively mellow high, and found this strain calms anxiety very well. Honestly have no clue how I’m able to write right now. I’m easily at a 10. I don’t think anything I write can do this strain justice. Very peppery, flavorful, and extremely yummy. I love smoking it out of my bong because I can taste more citrus that way. 4/5 because of the pepper taste, it slightly burned my nose. creeps up on you, sleepy time makes me feel lethargic Great high! Can’t have too much of it tho it’ll bore you out easy. This cross is a really good one. Smells a bit different, taste and aroma are really sweet and smooth. Gives you a great feeling hybrid buzz, not too much on the couch lock. Definitely more of the gsc genetics are coming through, feeling gooood Good taste, nice high. Happily surprised !!! I really didn’t like the smell or taste. 😝 To this date my favorite strain of all time. Wedding Cake fucks me uppp! It’s a favorite for sure. When I was smoking concentrate, I did not have grand mal seizures all summer but had 2 when I stopped smoking. ~ So in 2019 I reignited my love for buddha and I got use to it quick! Finding strong enough strains has been difficult. Wedding Cake has become my favorite strain. I love cookies abd the combo of gsc and cherry pie is almost perfect for me! You can\\'t go wrong with WC if you like being high lmao - paranoid (Low)\\n- happy (drunk tipsy feeling)(worry free)\\n- dry mouth \\n- energy/melo/relaxed\\n- social \\n- hungry \\n- horny This particular strain has lots of relaxing symptoms although it does provide / trigger some sweet euphoric and happy notes. It smells extremely sweet and smokes super smooth. One of my favorite hybrids hands down. Favorite strain, wedding cake never fails to pick me back up again. Was really excited when they said it was strain of year. Method: One pinch in my PAX. \\n\\nHigh: The onset begins with a tightening between the eyes and a slightly tingling body. I am aware of the effects elevating, but nothing too cerebral or introspective. It rounds our to a nice even bodied high with some nice laziness in the eyes and forehead. \\n\\nRating: 4.5/5 This was so fucking nxa An excellent hybrid. Vaped some this evening and have really enjoyed the high!!  My buzz is very balanced physically and mentally. Feels like a great strain for just hanging out at home or a party. I\\'d would definitely recommend!!! Citrus and vanilla.  Gorgeous buds. Hits your body first then floats to your head - 5 out of  5 allll day !  A must try strain for pure relaxation Amazing but STRONG AF BE CAREFUL WITH THIS IT\\'LL COUCH LOCK YOU FRFR I love this strain! For real, I really really enjoy this strain. I have found that it’s relaxing, but not enough to knock me out. Very calming high, with a little energy on the back end. I highly highly suggest this strain! A yummy and relaxing high. My body is tingling. This is a favorite for me. just took a couple hits of this and i am feeling great! everything is okay in life right now and i’m happy and relaxed :) Made it easy to get up and move around. Pain and fatigue were alleviated. I could see how this could make work a bit easier, however there is also a sedating effect. Definitely good for a few hours of afternoon or evening relaxation. GOD DAM IM BUT NAKED THINKING ITS RAINING IN MY KITCHEN, \\n\\nBUY THIS STRAIN \\n\\nps: Great American 🇺🇸 One of my favorite strains for anxiety relief and stress relief and prevention. Puts you in a nice happy calm mind state but doesn’t couch lock you too much so you can remain productive throughout the day. Best strain no cap Gets the job done, but tastes gross and makes your mouth really watery. The headache on the comedown is pretty bad so keep ibuprofen close Top shelf cannabis.  Very lite taste like a sweet cake or sugary donut. Im a heavy smoker and tolerance isnt a thing no matter when you smoke this.  Frosty, spot of purple on the nugs. Very enjoyable. Highly recommend and if you get let me know!! Nobody uses gsc x cherry pie. Here in Washington state all the major producers use triangle kush x animal mints done by jungle Boyz. the confusing thing is that you list the wrong genetics yet have a chart showing the triangle cross. This strain is good for people looking something better than blue cookies or something like it As an anxious person, pink cookies (wedding cake) is the perfect blend of sativa/indica. Soooo good for anxious thoughts without too much sedation I deal with depression and an anxiety disorder. after smoking a bowl of wedding cake it made me feel so much better and was able to make it through the rest of my day. This DANK IS FIRE !!! Careful to MICRODOSE !!! Duration of 3 to 5 hours, no problem. I cleaned my whole apartment and then went to bed. When I woke up, I felt amazing. Productive and relaxed is the perfect combo. I hope the flower is the same. Allowed me to sleep after taking ADHD medication too late in the day. This strain will leave your eyes dry mouth dry BUT it’s great if you want to sleep or be knocked tf out it’s a subtle but heavy high smells great burns great and is strong. Wedding Cake is by far one of my favorite strains! Can be smoked any time of the day and will adjust to exactly the high you need. On top of that, it is absolutely delicious.. sweet and earthy. Great tasting and smells amazing \\nOne of the best strains I\\'ve tried all year Great high for a heavy smoker awesome gass , so FUCKIIINNGGG smooth LOVED IT Dude I smoke almost everyday, but I smoked this shit just a second ago and got so fucking high. Like ridiculously high. I’m high as fuck right now. This is me and my girls favorite strain.   Sweetest giggly euphoric very talkative and there’s always very horny. Good daytime nighttime all around High. Very lovely Simply insane. I’m a hardcore consumer and most of the strains seem to don’t have any effect anymore, but when I smoked this, I was on my bed for like an hour or 2 spacing. Everything I watched on the internet seemed fun and cool. All the stress I had at that moment, faded away like dust in the wind. Ever since then, no strain ever got me this high again. \\n\\nSo, basically, this strain is favorable if you smoke more than you should. This flower was SUPER potent and got me ripped off a few hits out the old bong. This strain will get you super high but it made me very dizzy to the point of throwing up and no other weed has ever done that to me This is a strain if your looking to be fully functional after a bowl or blunt of wedding cake, not a strong high but a mellow buzz. 6-7/10 Pretty decent strain, highly recommended. Smells & tastes amazing. Smoked it with a very mild wrap & the taste alone is amazing. The high is a calm but energizing high, & makes me want to paint. Love it! For me it\\'s exactly as described. One hit leaves me uplifted for a good hour then it settles in to a nice relaxed and chill feeling. The only drawback for me is that I want to eat. And eat. Absolutely love this strain, the first few times it made me extremely sleepy, it totally put me on my ass. After I got used to it I found it to be a mellow and euphoric high. Love this strain! I mixed it with some Buddha dog walker, and dolato and it was amazing!!!!!!! Cross of two of my favorite strains Starts with crisp, citrus notes that burns off as earthly, chocolatey aromas.\\n\\nHighs come in waves and gently rocks your spine from side-to-side. Pleasantly distracting but not the best for attention-consuming activities.\\n\\nSharpens sounds and steadies energy levels for walks, concerts, etc. with no paranoia. Heavy hitting strain that brings instant relief. This is a pretty decent strain, but I just dont understand this cookie strain craze. ive had about every variety of cookies and the only one to really stand out is the Garlic Cookies, that stuff is just straight fire from another weird alien planet. all these other cookie strains look and smell incredible but lack any sort of definitive flavor. The wedding cake smells very floral almost like a dryer sheet. Had a sweet earthy taste but nothing mind blowing. Ill pass on this one next time. It is a good strain for people that are aiming for a psychedelic, trippy type of high. Gets its job done as a very potent strain but that completely outweighs what you try to look for in an indica-dominant one. Not saying its a bad strain but for me, it\\'s not what I was looking for in getting high.\\nPros: Trippy, Gets you horny, Floors you\\nCons: Not recommended for relaxation, sleep, working great flavour nd buzz. perfect to relax I tried the Triple 7 version of this strain. Not much to look at. Green, hairs, crystals, run of the mill appearance. Smell is a lot like other cookies strains: strong, doughy, sweet. Taste is super pleasant. If you’re a smoker you’ll know as soon as you hit it it’s dope. Starts gradually and is a 50/50 buzz at first and stays that way for 20 minutes or so before the sativa effects slowly shed into a heavy indica experience. Stock your cupboard and fridge cuz this one makes you hungry! Great pain relief. Chillin’ with a full belly. Long lasting. Get it. This strain is amazing like wow I really consider one of my favorite strains definitely helps relax and sleep. minor traces of paranoia for me though. You\\'re not married to Mary until you\\'ve had a piece of this cake. This strain has got a nice smelling aroma that I could tell that it was a pretty good strain. Smoked it w/ friends and everybody was having a blast. 10/10 Sour tart cherry flavor with a sweet vanilla aftertaste. The scent of this bud matches similarly to its flavor profile. Head high almost immediately felt. Peppery terpenes may cause coughing (however a large contributor to this strains great flavor). One of my favorite strains and a very popular strain amongst my many other stoner friends. Its girl scout cookie lineage  also makes it great for baking sweet eddibles. Great stuff have been so stressed and this really relaxed me! This is my first time smoking weed. omg I\\'m high andthis is just wonderful. i felt at first and then that was that. Sweet, similar to ice cream cake only more peppery It is really hard to decide a strain is my favorite above all others, but I\\'m pretty close to accepting that Wedding Cake may be it. This strain is everything I want from cannabis. When I use it, I get very happy, a little giggly, and very relaxed. It is a very good time every single time I use it. Omg this gave me a boost of energy then a relaxed feeling. Great stuff! Don\\'t expect to go to far lol it\\'s a must try Was very relaxing and calming. Good balance of slight body high and head high. Nothing phenomenal about it for me, but good day time strain. Didn’t feel real sedated, was still getting stuff done, but probably wouldn’t have wanted to go driving. Probably good for a social atmosphere, was definitely more talkative I did this strain with my wife on a date night and we loved it. Made the sex cosmic like. I got an ounce of Wedding Cake and I have to say it grinds wonderfully and the hits are potent. I love love this strain :D Fire. Got super high One of my personal favorites. Gave me a rlly good high . This strain is phenomenal..... \\nThe taste is really smooth and fruity.... \\nand then.......\\nWow!!! you get that feel-good energy/without the edge of the jitters...\\nmakes me want to turn up the tunes and get things done.... \\nLooked for a few years now... and finally found the perfect strain for \\nanxiety, pain relief and just all-around relaxation....\\nMy Favorite....found it a Curaleaf/Florida I had a great time on it. Very smooth but very effective. Very calming and stress relieving. Used DabU brand Wedding Cake Crumble. Amazing taste and amazing high! I’ll always think of hot, wet, uninhibited sex when I think of this strain. \\n\\nIt seems to flip a switch, causing my previously dormant motor to run on high idle. Must have sex when I’m baked on this.\\n\\nA relaxing but not couch lock buzz, mostly cerebral. Not a lot of body buzz.\\n\\nI buy this every time I visit the dispensary.\\n\\nVery highly recommend for anxious women with depression and no sex drive. WOW! 😲 Taste so good and beautiful nug I tried this strain on vape pen with westcoast and it tasted like chemicals I don’t know if its supposed to taste like that but its really bad Nice flavor The loss of time is real with this strain but not in it\\'s usual random, distracted way. \\nPhysical rundown: Scoliosis and 2 compressed disks-No current back pain which is generally all day every day and I just tolerate.\\nMental rundown: NO and I mean no anxiety. Even with microdosing during the day and an evening smoke anxiety is always underlying. Not with Wedding Cake. Perfect... it has everything and nice body/head high. Great taste and high thc.... I loved this strain so much!! I didn’t get much of it it since I had never tried it before, but man it was great! Made my girl and I super giggly and talkative, absolutely enjoyed the experience. Most def my all time favorite, hits like a dab and the smell is very floral. Good head high that lasts for hours if you wake and bake right. The Taste is Certainly Unique. Really Nice Flavor and Aroma. I Took 2 dabs and a bong rip about 30min ago and im plastered. GREAT STRAIN for a day off or chilling on the weekend with the boys Love this. I like the sweet to earthy ratio and the long lasting effects. Very beautiful nugs, covered in crispy trycromes. It truly is a special strain. totally helped my wave of panic attacks i was having. a little goes a long way, and it was enough to make me feel veery tingly. HIGHLY RECOMMEND! Try out this strain with your best friends if you want to have a good ass time! Definitely made me feel very energetic & very very giggly. I have no negatives about this one! This would be perfect for a party as it almost makes you feel drunk! Beautifuly flawless First time smoking in years. I used to smoke daily, but started developing what I would call a high induced paranoia. My highs were terrible panic ridden episodes. \\n\\nI chose this strain because of its low probability of paranoia and anxiousness. I quit drinking and was looking for an alternative to cope with stress. This strain did not let me down.\\n\\nI rolled a pinner and took probably a good four or five hits. It was pretty slim, so probably a single bowl of a one hitter. I showered while I waited for the high to set it. It came on slow but I could definitely feel a change in my brain.  There was a brief moment where I felt too high, but I was able to focus on the positive and bring myself back from panic. \\nI did some tidying up and then soduku while listening to Bach. It was a nice, calming, relaxing high, followed by the best nights sleep in weeks. Exactly what I needed. This strain got me high af and me and my buddy got creative as fuck. I’m pretty fucked up tbh some good shit Great for a party environment. Made me really alive Wonderful. Absolutley great. Physically calming, mentally focusing. Tastes great. Slight citrus hints and undertones of earthy herbs. Smell is fragrant and balanced, but not distinct from the general \"weed smell\" in any real way. \\n\\nSeen it tested out to more like 26-27% THC locally. This is the definition of a Stoney strain. Not a very impressive body high, but very relaxing, while not being overly sleepy. If you like feeling stoned, this is the strain for you. Not a good strain for during the day, as functioning normally will be fairly difficult lol. \\n\\nThe smell of this weed is absolutely amazing. I got a nice mix of lemon and pine that that I wish I could have in a spray can. The flower I got was from clandestine farms and was super frosty and potent. \\n\\nOverall I’m impressed, but it’s not my personal favorite. For relaxing I’d rather go with something that has a little better body high. It’s also not the best for the day time or in social settings. Good Strong Indica-Strong Hybrid. It will keep you in a good state of euphoria for a while and if you have sleeping issues, highly recommend to smoke this before bed. I was lucky enough to get my hands on a wedding cake cartridge, and it was amazing! \\nIt’s a Very very visual high , I had maybe 5-6 hits from my cartridge pen, and that’s all it took, haha I’m ripped AF , I feel very hungry , And groggy , yet energetic, definitely hard to play this off around family or friends who don’t know you smoke , you WILL BE mega stoned! Nice, balanced strain that packs a punch. Super tasty and super frosty.  Keef for days off this stuff. One of my new favorite strains. Takes a few hits to set in. Starts in your chest and spreads out through your arms then you to your head. Last about 45 minutes which is more than most strains for me. By far the best bud I\\'ve ever been blessed to smoke no matter where I am in the US of A!!!!\\nHands down!!! My, so far, absolute strain. Reading the other reviews, and I couldn’t agree more to most of them! Had a Stick.e vape of this strain and I have to say after 2 puffs I feel it very easily. I was feeling like shit and was reluctant to smoke too much and this got to me to a happier place quickly. You feel the classic head high (or like a heavy head feeling) while feeling relaxed and mellow overall. Not feeling stress from little worries and can almost melt away while still being coherent. I’m gonna give this one 3 stars because for the most part this weed was really good. You could tell just by smelling it it was good shit, it only took a 1 hitter or two to get a good high going and I’ve been smoking for over two years daily. The reasons it’s not 5 stars is because the last time I smoked and the time before I got really bad anxiety and had a panic attack, this could be because I smoked too much so maybe it’s my fault but if you’re trying to find a decent high this strain isn’t bad I\\'ve been smoking this while hanging out around my apartment by myself now that it\\'s getting colder, and I\\'m liking it. Great mix of relaxed happy vibes. Easy to get random shit done while listening to tunes and dancing, or chill out on the couch for awhile. Definitely calming 🙏🏽👏🏽🔥 I like to get this strain if I\\'m looking to gift it to someone. It\\'s tasty, it looks good and it has very relaxing and euphoric effects. Very nice deep and mellow buzz, for both the head and the body.  Relaxing in all senses.  If you love cherry pie but just want it in indica form this is it.  Couch potatoes approved. The hint of the peppery gsc taste is there but kts not as strong as it usually is, you can still get the citrus taste as well, it\\'s more mellow taste wise than some of the other gsc spin offs, very smooth to smoke. 2 lighters up for wedding cake. This strain is decent but personally it felt a little redundant to me both in the high and it\\'s lineage. I talk to ALOT of ppl who either forgot or never knew that the original GSC that 1st became popular was (OG Kush x Durban Poison x Cherry Pie),while most ppl believe it to be just (OG Kush x Durban Poison), which is the most common pheno nowadays,  so the finished product of those 3 was the original GSC crossed with a strain that is already in it, so to me personally the high felt VERY similar to regular GSC & I wouldn\\'t go out of my way to pay (for example) $50 for a top shelf 8th of wedding cake if there\\'s a $25-$35 8th of GSC on the same shelf then I\\'d just stick with GSC everytime cuz it\\'s cheaper and has the same high as wedding cake The taste and smell of this strain is great. Just get a weak high from it so I’m not much of a fan. Relaxes me but not that much. Definitely don’t get stoned off this. Okay. I am usually a Sativa Gal. this hybrid leans just enough indica that it relaxes me but doesnt numb my mind. Everything kind of slowed down. This one was strong, but no real unpleasantness with overindulgence. felt alot behind the eyes. The smoke was a little harsh. bit of coughing. VERY good for pain. Perfect for pmdd and fibromyalgia. You\\'d think a strain called Wedding Cake would be sweet, but it\\'s not at all. It has the piney pungency of several other indicas I\\'ve tried, including Star Killer and Pura Vida. There\\'s also a hint of citrus. There\\'s nothing unusual about the flavor, but there\\'s also nothing frivilous. It just gives it to you straight, classic, and unaltered. If you\\'ve gotten used to the fruity stuff, take it back to the basics with this mature, confident strain. Way too harsh on my throat. If you have any issues with your throat I highly recommend staying away from it. high af i think i smoked too much it went straight to my head lml Very nice tangy smell. Smooth taste on inhale. Very earthy notes when you exhale. Light a candle and work on music all day. 👍🏾 let’s you focus! Love this strain! It definitely is one of my top 10 now, only downsides is that it makes me super hungry. Also I get super sleepy when coming down from the high which is kinda nice. Great for pain, migraines and helps Relieve my Chronic Lyme disease. This strain can have you feeling like you can hear the Plants breathing..\\n\\nComplete body high..  amps your senses This strain is interesting. In-and-of-itself, Wedding Cake is just- UGH- the worst. Paranoia straight to a dizzy nauseating high. I do not recommend. But this strain has great children. Ice Cream Cake is the Wedding Cake Strain done correctly. got me relaxed as hellll rn and i smoked a bowl out of an apple pipe wit it. Smoked a blunt with my fiancé and she says she feels like time is still. I would say the vanilla description on Tate was on point. I feel very relaxed and euphoric. Getting munchies rite about now and I am feeling spaced out. Great after a 12 hour shift at work jacked on caffeine. Knocks me right out. We rolled a raw wrap and we didn’t have to smoke another afterwards 😂 Then the next day we did one hit from a one-hitter and we were feeling it! Such a fantastic strand! Wedding Cake had a great taste that left me perfectly baked! Smoked a few joints with my friend over a couple of days and we both agreed it was one of our favorite tasting strains! bought this on the premium shelf....a 2 gram nug with the PRETTIEST mug stared me in my eyes. so sparkly with all that keef and it smelled like a dream i can’t even begin when I used this strain, I had a very foggy head if that makes any sense. (I\\'m using it now so forgive me lol). It\\'s great if you just wanna watch television or something. but I personally wouldnt reccomend it for work or if you have a busy day. Smoked 1 hit from flower to ⅔ lung capacity. Felt nice uplifting effects, and very happy, with mild time distortions. An hour later, after taking a shower and shaving (and having experienced no physical impairments), I took 2 more such hits. Now shit is getting real. I feel delighted by touch and fascinated by the sensory hypersensitivity, which lends itself to physical arousal. I’m not sleepy, yet tempted to have couch lock. Still, I have been documenting the journey in journals now for the last few hours and I don’t feel negativity associated with this depth of self-reflection.\\nI’m going to marry Wedding Cake. good shit eh This is my go to strain. Will always keep some around no matter what. It takes away pain like no other and calms the mind from anything PTSD / anxiety related. Allows me to really focus the following day after a great night\\'s sleep. It will also make sex incredible because it doesn\\'t induce a couch lock effect and makes all the good nerves tingly if you know what I mean. My all time favorite strain! Best for anxiety and insomnia! Very flowery taste and super potent! Flowers or concentrate, smoking or vaporizing, wedding cake is always good! A little like GSC just better! Also this cake is gluten free! ;-) Probably my favorite strain. Great for anti-anxiety and a sense of overall well-being. Good hybrid with sativa leaning properties. I was relaxed, but not sleepy. Relieved my headache in 15 minutes. Focused. Two big hits from a silicone pipe had me functioning for a while, and then it hit like a train and I found myself staring at the ceiling for about 15 minutes.  After the zone, I was relaxed, pain free, and functional.  My neighbor is a 75 year old man with back issues, I let him hit and watched him settle back and enjoy his evening without his usual grunts and groans.  A definite for anyone with chronic pain who needs a break to relax. Wedding Cake snuck up on me. It initially left me quite relaxed and social... and then it turned into a pretty giggly state. I definitely conjured a bit of humor for myself and those around me. It\\'s a subtle aromatic and one I enjoyed. It\\'s a great strain for dinner with friends. love it Takes a while to hit you. Definitely a “creeper”. Tases like vanilla cookies. Heavy on the indica side very nice muscle relaxation. Couch locked for sure. Must have for high pain days . This is some of the best cannabis i\\'ve ever had. It smells gassy and sweet, reminiscent of cherry or some fruit like that. My eighth tested at 29.09% so I was very excited, but worried that all the terpenes had been replaced with THC. Sometimes it seems like high THC flower can lack flavor; have you noticed that? Anyways, this strain is one I think needs to be tried at least once by everyone who considers themselves a \"cannasseur\". Also, the BHO is amazing! It really gives you a taste of what the flower tastes like hazed by all that THC. I will buy again when it comes around. I\\'m been using this strain, and I love Wedding Cake.Its great for day time and Night time.. Strong, sleepy, lightheaded not my favorite, it gives me headaches and doesn\\'t taste very good. it was cool........wasn\\'t really what I was looking for at the time but it did the job Very dense pungent nugs that you can break into tiny bits (not ground just torn apart) and get one of the best heady highs I\\'ve had in a long time 😚 Absolutely fantastic! Described as wanting to get married, you definitely are that happy i really enjoyed this strain for anxiety and depression. When I smoke this, I feel like my life is pretty great. Still light enough to get daily tasks done, but expect to zone out a few times. Good head rush and laugh. Minor body high. One of my fav hybrids it always makes me feel hella mellow and chill like it’s parent strain GSC, but it doesnt have you completely poo brain like a lot of heavy indicas do. Good social strain or strain to unwind with while not having to worry about immediately knocking out. One of my go tos to this day. Very mellow with a little bodily side effects. Great for doing errands are the house and lounging. Good Sunday strain. This is kind if strain that puts you in a creative mood. Definitely stimulates the mind If you are able to remain a functional person while aloft upon Wedding Cake’s wings—I salute you! It will roll over you like a Tsunami of Bliss, caressing your whole being with sumptuous waves and even spiraling vortices of joy. The pleasure of being alive resounds exuberantly from this strain; and indeed the experience of partaking of Wedding Cake feels like a wedding—coming into sublime unity with Life itself!...from the sensual to the spiritual, from the body to the spirit, all aglow with joyful consummation. When I treat the consumption of it like consummation—relishing and luxuriating in each toke, allowing every taste and quality to blossom like a garden—then every hit is like a honeymoon! Current situation: my roommate said she feels like a banana. Time is slower and I can’t stop smiling. A chocolate milkshake sounds nice. Yeah wedding cake is 10/10 One of the best strains i\\'ve smoked in years. Perfect balance sativa, indica. The flavor is straight-up vanilla. This is one of them strange you can smoke for the rest of your days and not be mad about it. If you can find it, grab it!super smooth on the first two tokes and then that third or fourth puts the pressure right in your lungs! Cookies really knocked it out of the ballpark with this one! I\\'ve had Wedding Cake before but this stain is exceptional!\\nI filled a bowl and inhaled 3 big hits. Within minutes the tip of my tongue went numb, visual acuity became more intense and my body felt like it was floating on a cloud,(mind you, I\\'ve lost 40lbs in the last few months).\\nThe cerebral high is not too much for day time use for the every day user, but first time users beware!\\nThis shit is the bomb!! Beautiful strain! It smells strong but you get a nice after taste. Fun,giggly high. Whether you want to create art or chill... it can do both. Sex is AMAZING on this too. strange stuff. just ok in small doses; whole body warmth and visuals at the heavier. no joke. This is the best flower I have ever smoked, and this is my absolute favorite strain! Grown by Item Nine Labs in Arizona, I believe. I felt like I was slowly transportated into a soft trip that gradualy become more intense. I felt how my brain melted into my eyes. Hands down one of my all time favs. It\\'s worth it for the taste alone. Best experienced dry vaping or smoking a bowl for flavor. I don\\'t get the same flavor profile with one hitters. Fast acting, but smooth high. Good for if you just need to slow things down and focus. Be careful about using as daytime pot, it can be a bit heavy if you need to go anywhere. Otherwise I found it to be a pretty productive high. I can usually get a lot of house chores done it get tons of writing done. This is definitely in my top five. great high semi productive. This strain is serious if u a beginner u not ready with this strain your world will not be a world Strong aroma\\nLight green color\\nMedium light nuggs Mostley indica. Great stuff. Tastes and feels like GSC and OG Kush. Wedding Cake is a strain that will always be my favorite. I got this in bud and concentrate form and it was absolutely amazingly relaxing. I took like two hits and I was outta here. Bottom line is....... I love it. \\n\\n\\n-the girl in the StonerCouple38 This is by far my favorite strain. If you want to be in a good mood when you get high then try wedding cake. I can’t say enough good about this strain. Doesn’t matter if you’re smoking alone or in a social event. This strain taste sweet and smokes even better. By far my favorite. indica leaning hybrid. Leaves you relaxed and happy, couch lock city. Good, but nothing great or special about it. But then again that may be because I got it in Massachusetts. I’ve had a lot of strains from dispensaries in Colorado, Cali, and Washington and nothing I’ve had from a Mass dispensary would be top shelf there. At a dispensary out West they would all be mids. So your experience may vary. Wedding cake is now my new favorite strain. It will leave you feeling extremely relaxed and in a great mood. You will feel this strain fast for sure! Highly highly recommend Made me just feel very good in general. Got caught in a lot of thought loops. I have severe ADHD but one bowl of this magic strain helps me go through the day without any complications and doesn’t leave me feeling like a zombie like adderall does and I can still remain my happy energetic self! I highly recommend! Only wedding cake I’ve ever liked!! This strain keeps delivering whether you want to write poetry or have sex.\\nOMG the sex is amazing on this one. 5 minute long orgasm is almost too much. Deep in myself thoughts. The after affect may feel down with myself. Very Potent Effect. Wedding Cake has helped me with my anxiety. Very strong strain with very powerful medicinal properties. Fine. Nothing special. One of the best strains I\\'ve ever came across. Not a creeper , the side effects hit instantly within minutes , definitely not for new smokers. exceptional smoke 10/10 My current favorite strain. If you\\'re looking for that good old 1980 skunk weed, \"I\\'m too high to be giggly,\" feeling, well, here you go. Yoooooooo, if you want to feel happy af and laugh your b.e.a tiful ape butt off? Take this shit right here. Hits hard af. Makes ya happy places tingle know what I\\'m sayin?🤭👀😉yassssssssssssssssssssssssssssssahhhhhhhhhhhhhh. Live Queens, livvvvvvvvvveeeeeahhhh! Dry mouth like a muffahhhh. Can\\'t have enough water! I think I\\'ve cream goes well with this one! One of the best strains since MARATHON! hits very smooth with a sweet after taste! The nugs were sticky with white coating and orange hairs. I knew automatically from the coating that it would hit me between the eyes! It lived up to all the reviews! One of my favorite strains so far. I now have an emotional attachment to this strain. It makes me feel sexy. \\n\\nWedding Cake would make an amazing date night strain. Super bomb flower! super nice flavour and head high This is a pretty classic steady high. Prolly be my go to if I had to host a dinner party & passed it along.  Not my favorite but still good. It’s predictable & steady. Body high, time is slower. If you just wanna be high & like that feeling in your feet, then pick this one. Nothing too fancy, not very euphoric Picked up a VSPR cartridge of Wedding Cake at Temescal Wellness in Framingham (great dispensary).  Nice, subtly sweet taste followed by a happy, talkative euphoric state.  Makes me a little “slow” physically;  not couch lock, but it’s as if I need to put 20% more effort in to do anything besides be high and laugh!   I won’t be hitting this before yardwork or the gym...that’s Tangie’s job. Powerful, creeper high. Take this one a few hours before bed and you\\'ll be charged up for the last bit of the day followed by a long peaceful sleep. Very VERY hungry strain. Have plenty of snacks and candy about. Ready ice cream is a must. Taste is earthy and pine with mulch and a slight harshness. Effects last about 2-3 hours per bowl. Creeper. Handle with care! All I can say is WOW! A  series of happy little accidents is how I stumbled upon this strain. I was looking for a deep indica to aid with my anxiety, chronic back pain, as well as persistent insomnia. Originally I was set on a Kush hybrid (obviously an indica dominant variety) when my homie suggested Wedding Cake saying it would be much better for my symptoms. Initially I assumed this strain as sativa dominant; my assumption being that wedding cake would allow you to stay “up” and perform on such an occasion as a wedding night (which I also have upcoming as well but I digress). The nugs were super impress; dark, hairy, dense, fragrant - all indica indicators.\\n\\nAgainst my preconceived notion, I rolled with his suggestion. From the first toke, I instantly felt mental clarity. The feeling wasn’t like the hyperactive energy I get from sativas, rather a sense of focus and calm. Any anxiety, stress, or depression melted away. I took a few more rips, and felt a warm anti inflammatory sensation surround my body. Aches and pains in my lower back began to dissipate as I smoked. Just what the doctor ordered.\\n\\nHowever, as I continued to smoke the second bong load, a super strong indica high took effect, the infamous “couch lock”. I welcomed it, others might not. I didn’t end up sleeping, just vegging out a bit. This feeling isn’t as pronounced as other indicas (Grand Daddy Purple, Pre 98 Bubba Kush etc.), but later that evening it did help me fall fast asleep. Another interesting effect is that I don’t normally get the munchies when I smoke, but this strain definitely gave me an appetite for sweets! Ironically I indulged with a slice of cake!\\n\\nThis strain is ideal for me, both medically and recreationally. Personally, there are absolutely not negative effects. I cannot sing Wedding Cake’s praises enough! There is a lot to enjoy with this strain! Break off a slice and let the bliss persist! This is a beloved strain for a reason.  Me and my wife are higher than planets now.  It has that diesel GSC feel and flavor.  It keeps me oddly spacey and focused.  I feel high but can focus on anything without paranoia making it too loud.  It\\'s a strong strain and I recommend it.  Fucking is probably good on it. extremely sticky. not good in a dry oven vape. great otherwise This strain was spectacular. Judging by the genetics, I knew before I smoked it that wedding cake was going to be a grand slam. And it was. If you enjoy GSC, you’ll love wedding cake. The terpene description was very accurate too - upon exhale, I tasted a sweet, fluffy, and gentle vanilla aroma. This strain is amazing for daytime use as it perks you up but not too much as to make you intensely focused on things like a diesel strain. Get yourself a delicious slice of wedding cake today! This particular strain is an intense body experience. It gives a light feeling without making you tired. About a month ago my buddy came over and said I had to try this strain he just picked up. It had fantastic aromas and nice dense nugs. The first bong rip was nice and smooth and I could tell this was a little bit better than what I usually smoke (upper mid to top shelf stuff). Wow!! I could barely finish the third hit as I was pretty high!!\\n\\nAfter a few minutes I was extremely relaxed and drifting in and out of zoning (but still very alert). Our conversations were all over the place but still seemed to make sense, lol. \\n\\nFast forward 30-45 minutes and I’m trying to make dinner and still very high.  Then 30 minutes after that my wife and I are eating that dinner and watching a movie. About 10 minutes into the movie I asked her a really stupid question about the movie and she just looked at me and said “damn, how high are you?”\\n\\nLong story short, this is my new top strain as it gets me way higher than anything else I’ve smoked in a long time and I’m a daily smoker. Get yourself some and get a silly grin on your face!! Husband and I have gotten this strain a couple times now, and we love it every time! Tastes and smells soo good, and gets us high af! Love it ❤️ I grew Wedding Cake S1 by Phenofinder seeds. It was the most beautiful plant iv ever grown. Cookie dominant structure but pure black leaves and buds come harvest time.  Wow!!!\\nI yielded 3.5 ounces which was the smallest yield from the 4 different strains i grew. I got 4.5 from the rest. But wedding cake was the Jar that emptied first as it was by far the strongest. In fact id go as far to say this was the strongest Indica iv ever grown. And the effects were 100% indica. \\nAbsolutly lovely. \\nUp there with Holy Grail Kush as best smokes ever! News Flash! Just in ladies and gentlemen. . As of 8/14/2019, I Just picked up a pretty good batch at 25% THC a few hours ago. Smells fantastic. Looks fantastic. Tastes fantastic. The High is grade A+ all the way. Slightly Indica dominant without the old couch lock. Smoke lots? Then you may get couch lock. Seems fine to use as a wakey and bakey through evening hours, if that\\'s your thing. All the benefits that go with real premium, top of the line cannabis that has been keeping itself up around 25% no matter who the farmer botanist is. I am an old guy, who has tried many strains since the early 80\\'s. Trust this old man when I say, this strain sincerely deserves 5 stars for its full package greatness. Picked up a couple grams of WC at Main Street in the Couve upon reccomendation of bud tender. I was looking for wedding crasher but had to do with this.\\n\\nAll I need to see is this is freaking awesome pot. Great nose, great taste and super potent with immediate whams across the head. \\n\\nNice to the max. Got some of this from L’eagle in Denver and wow! Took three rips from the bong and I was stupid high. Had the urge to listen to the bare necessities from jungle on YouTube then ended up non stop laughing at the orangutang singing “I wanna be like you” very heavy body high and fierce munchies. Smells good sweet, earthy, and like sugary baked goods almost. Sweet taste on exhale. Top notch strain Delicious and savoury. Doesn’t taste chemically. But gave me really bad pasties so (dry mouth) and made me so tired so if that’s what you need then 100% go for it. But I don’t like being so sleepy. Very heavy strain , tastes like sweet doughy cake with a little kush, very sticky but I don’t think leafy has the cross right. I think Wedding Cake is Triangle Mints x Animal Mints. The flowers I have from 710 Labs don’t look anything like cherry pie or Girl Scout Cookies, and the high is overwhelming and strong , this is one of my favorite buds , lasts almost as long as OG for me when I have it but since it’s rare I go through it quick, Str8organics has a good cut also but 710 Labs and Alien Labs have the best cut of Wedding Cake, there is also a Strawberry Wedding Cake that I have tried, I was not impressed, no great flavor, dry buds, seemed like a fake strain.Wedding Cake is a must have, if you see it buy it, especially if it’s by a good grower. JTF I’m using this as a vape cartridge (for my very first time ever) and I mean, wow. Wow. I don’t even want to smoke a cigarette with this shit. \\n\\nAt first it starts off as a nice energetically calm high, helps with pain and anxiety, but you will get DECENTLY stoned from more than 1 hit. \\n\\nIt tapers off into a very relaxing sleep/hungry mix- I would have slept even better if I had hit it before I slept. \\n\\nOverall I’m pretty impressed and hope I don’t go through this too quickly. I had to pass.. got a cart by 1937 and discovered it triggers panic attacks in my system.. worst week of my life but, my friend loves the hell out of that strain. Try it Amazing high. Hard hitting and it hits you hard. I feel it in my head and body. Its the perfect hybrid to be honest Really good high very cerebral but still relaxed and able to function. You will be hit with the cannabis bus though lol The form I am rating is TKO\\'s full spectrum, solvent-less cartridge. It tastes like wedding cake, like enough to make me wonder if it\\'s flavored! Totally clean, yet a complete depth charge. The high is nice and heady. The lineage says it all. I was looking for the best Indica I could find and I was more than satisfied with this one. Perfect weed to smoke at the end of the day of course, smoking it in the morning makes the day feel really slow. This weed is good if you have nothing planned for the day, didn\\'t feel too good being high on this and having to do things. Exceptional relaxer after a long day. WoW. Im usually not a hybrid smoker. I stick to the indica side, but i tried this bud and its awesome. This hybrid is on my top 5 best bud list. A perfect balance... nice head buzz without the heavy body sleepy feel of indica strain. Perfect with my morning coffee to get a busy day started. Very uplifted creative happy mood. Nice slightly sweet taste goes down smooth. The buds were fat, tight, beautiful crystal frosting. With purple green kaleidoscope colors throughout. Absolutely Delicious. 😆🙃🙃😎 This will almost surely exceed your expectations, no matter how high they are. It offers a pleasant body high while maintaining a sharp enough mind for conversation and lower energy creative pursuits. Anything sensory is enhanced by this strain, especially sex. This is a great strain for cuddling and sex. I get extremely high every time I smoke this, yet have virtually no paranoia. I also recommend this strain to anyone who becomes incommunicado after smoking because that will certainly not be a problem with this. It\\'s great for conversation, even for quiet people. Me and my fiancé smoked 7.5 grams and I honestly never been so high in my life One of my top 5 strains! What an absolute delight. This strain smells, tastes, and feels amazing. Provides for a heavy head based high that settles for a fluffy, happy state for a good few hours. Excellent, Beautiful, citrus like aroma. smoked this late at night and it gave me a Happy but relaxed feel. Definitely will put you to sleep if you aren’t active. One of the better indica dominant hybrids out there. I suffer from severe depression and anxiety and I find that this is the perfect mid day strain. i smoke it when writing emails and getting tedious tasks done. it provides a bit of an upper type feeling which helps get me out of bed on those harshly depressing days. would recommend. My wife and me picked up a vape cart of this strain and absolutely love it. The taste and the euphoria of it is amazing definitely will give it another go around The most balanced buzz I’ve ever had. Simply perfect in flavor and effect! I imagine we all have an equalizer switch board in our brains and this strain slides the switches to a harmonious middle ground. A truly rare and special genetic profile! This strain really speaks for itself, it is a delicious treat that has hard hitting indica affects, flavors are earthy, sweet, and peppery. Tastes very much like OG, with a lil pinch of sweet from the cookies, and peppery notes from the durban poison. Would highly recommend novice users to take caution as it hits very hard and is !!VERY POTENT!! So a little bit goes a long way.  I hope this review is helpful to someone who wants to try this strain or plans to try it in the future. It is worth giving a try! Smoke on y’all! top notch Well I started hitting my vape of this Strain by Toke-Ums. 3 small hits. Not good for someone with asthma. Not enough pinene or limonine terpenes in it for me. Its been about 15 minutes. Its definitely a creeper which I like. Getting glued to my chair. It feels like something is gently holding my body down. Muscles are relaxing. Eyes definitely getting heavy. Man I hope this doesn\\'t put me to sleep. Wow, I barely feel my pain on this stuff. My tummy is rumbling. Oh no! I definitely don\\'t need it to make me hungry. But to be honest, I haven\\'t eaten in a while. This strain does have a bold sweet earth taste to it. I thought it was a moldy taste at first. Sweet mold is what I describe it as with a pepper after-taste. At first I wondered if it was supposed to taste that way, and from Leafly apps\\' description, it is exactly what it should taste like. At 6 hits now. This is giving me a pretty balanced high. You do have to continuously toke to keep the best effects 😁😁😁. Geeat pain relief, relaxed muscles, makes you hungry (I\\'ll find out how much very soon), kind of dull brained with heavy eyelids but not necessarily sleepy YET! Lol. I have no doubt that I will sleep good tonight, at least till the stuff wears off. If you need rest, an appetite, and pain relief, this is your gal. Go Wedding Cake! Yes, she\\'s demonized! Ok now I know I\\'m stoned. Getting giggly too. Excellent strain...a nice balanced high, minimal munchie affect, relaxed but not sleepy, puts you in a good mood and excellent for strong erections. Will purchase again. Will purchase forever WOW!!! I\\'ve been smoking for 18yrs and for a good while I\\'ve convinced myself that I can\\'t get high like I used too unless I have a high quality hash or a high quality concentrate. I paid a fair bit more than what I normally do but it was worth every penny, it knocked my socks off. I\\'m an experienced smoker and it put me in lala land.\\nBuds are a lighter shade of green, covered in crystals and tastes similar as if it was a mix between AK47 and Bubblegum. Instant high and only got stronger from there. A really spacey one, but not drowsy like the indicas can be. I could still be creative on this. This strains hard hitter I took 2 to 3 rips (I usually take 5 or 6) and felt like I I took a gram dab I feel great. Truly relaxed and lifted with a beautiful earthy taste. I’m high as hell. Very Earthy.  Rich in Myrcene terpenes from Cherry Pie and Pinene from GSC.   Provides a light styled Indica that relaxes and relieves pain, but doesn\\'t lock you to the couch.  Remember to hydrate. Earthy flavor like GSC, light and sweet.  Good for workouts.  Probably will make you cough and forget what you were doing for a minute. I first tried it in Oregon and fell in love with the relaxed \\ncalm happiness I was experiencing. Smells good, tastes good, it\\'s gorgeous. I have recently come into contact with a preroll of it. I have a neck injury and couldn\\'t get comfortable in bed UNTIL I busted that bad boy out. The feelings of Oregonian love took me over and I slept like a baby the entire night. If you can get some... get some! Super calm and relaxing, great before bed. Made my chest a little tight at first but then relaxed into it. Easy to roll with One of the best, If not the best strains to have sex on.  Better than any pill, this will make you harder than a rock, you can have sex for hours and the recovery time is minutes, if you see this, stockpile it. I just picked up an eighth from my local dispensary. A little bit intense at first, but melts into blissful, relaxing high. Have snacks handy and enjoy lacks a punch. decent indica effects. ehh I had to create an account because of this strain...cartridge does this no justice...this is one of the best flower highs I have ever had. I love the sativas, but this was not sleepy. Laughed my ass off and I have had cherry pie, sunday driver, gsc, durban. Again I have never written anything, this is a bad ass strain grown right. No anxiety, if that helps anyone!! I just took one long, strong hit off a 1/2G cartridge rated at 90% and mannnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn............ Got a 1mg Refine cartridge, used w/ my newer Vuber pen (since both of my Bodhi pens stopped hitting after 5 or 6 months) I Took 2 or 3 descent puffs in the last hour and I can say I\\'ve been standing upright on my front porch, while enjoying listening to the birds and breeze go through the willows. It\\'s a perfect 72° shade and I feel calm. Content w/ no paranoia running through my head. This is just amazing- I had been waiting to try this and then-bam! It’s here in front of me. So after a long day tried this for my first time ever and was very impressed. So much so that it became my favorite strain. It has such a wide range of therapy benefits and an experience rolled into one. Smoking this definitely is an “ex it tastes really nice to smoke i got an ounce of this strain and love it. i feel the perfect hybrid with a great taste. the nugs i got were very keefy and great in size and moisture. Great little hybrid! super light, no couch lock, recommend for a sunny day BBQ! Awesome chill, its bad mood buster! Listen, I bought an 8th of Wedding Cake. Hands down, best canna experience I’ve had to date! A   B-E-A-Utiful strain to relax and ease joint/muscle pain. This dessert hybrid is perfect after a heavy meal of exercise 💪🏋️\\u200d♂️ Smoked this during my whole honeymoon..I love this strain.its some 🔥🔥🔥 Wedding cake imo falls closer to DP (Durban Poison) as Pink Cookie sways toward OG Cush. Regardless, sampling this extraordinary rope can rival eating a small slice of rich dessert.  Finishing it in one sitting can be detrimental to your canni-b diet. I enjoy sharing with friends at a close social and everyone agrees it pulls them back to a time long past filled with laughter.  Oval Approves.  Whodaba. Watching the women’s World Cup final right now on some wedding cake. Go team USA it’s lit 🔥 very relaxing my go-to strain, love Top Notch hybrid, relaxed and active, lost and found, up and down, left and right, forward and backward, direct and diverted, yum yum me want more No question it you relax. Helps with joint pain after exercise. It’s a winner!! wow. all i can say is this strain is freakin amazing! likeee.... seriously. this is definitely one of my top faves now. it\\'s strong asf. it smells great lol. everyone should try this strain out. Really enjoying this strain, picked some up at Emerald Triangle in Medford (which is a fucking fantastic shop btw). Great for anxiety, especially if you get paranoid in public when you’re high. That’s almost always a huge issue for me, but I feel absolutely great out and about on this strain. Helped with some of my joint pain too. Potent stuff! I decided to smoke a g of wedding cake before I mowed the lawn, I was in my backyard when I decided to smoke it due to my ability to have a safe and reliable woods in my backyard. I started mowing the lawn when I soon realized that my mind focused on one thing and one thing only. And that was to precisely cut the grass in a particular way. I feel as tho this strand caused me to achieve perfection and superior yardsmanship. I know that’s not a word but it’s tough. Then, mid mow, my mouth was very dry, but it felt like it was covered with something inside my mouth. Then it hit me! The saliva inside my mouth, started to feel as tho I had an actual wedding cake inside my mouth. This was the most eye opening weed experience I have ever smoked. I thank you North Carolina for your tremendous wedding cake. 🎂🎂🎂🎂🎂🎂🎂🎂🎂🎂🎂🎂🎂🎂🎂🎂🎂🎂🎂🎂🎂🎂🎂🎂🎂🎂🎂🎂🎂🎂 Beautifully dense mugs with lots of visible trichomes. Heavy-hitting Indica vibe but not heavy enough to put you right to sleep. Great for hanging out and giggling while watching TV. makes you do the chores even when you really don’t want to. keeps you married because the house is clean and the sex is fantastic. you’re hella mellow and able to talk to your partner in a civil manner about silly and serious topics. sounds like a strain that should be in ceremonies! Super Frosty! Sweet Smell and Taste with Much Pungent Hashy Funk.  Dense Buds and Thick Smoke.. Top Shelf Indica dominant for sure. Cleared a bowl out of a gravity bong and was flabbergasted. This is basically my main way of smoking and this is by far the tastiest strain to smoke unfiltered. It smells exotic and coats your sinuses in a sweet blanket that lingers for hours. The scent alone is award worthy. Top 2 all time favorite I want to try all the phenotypes of this masterpiece!! Phenomenal. Had a pink lemonade taste followed by a peppery aftertaste. Amazing relaxing high Nice OMG!!!!! a little bit goes a long way, too much and you\\'ll be drooling on yourself lol. Perfect for the end of the day. me and my husband had this a week after we got married. it\\'s a must I say I think I’m in love. I’m not typically into committing to a strain,  but this one takes the cake. \\n\\nOkay, I’ll stop with the cheesy puns. Anyway, the song I choose to represent wedding cake is Louis Armstrong’s, What a Wonderful World.\\n\\nYou should listen to it while reading this review, I’ll wait.\\n\\nBack already? Let the song really sink in. It is a wonderful world with wedding cake. \\n\\nAfter a couple of hits I was nice and stoned. I haven’t had a spasm since smoking and it took the edge off my pain.\\n\\nI’m ready to stretch out and relax into a (hopefully) sleep filled night.\\n\\nI’m definitely in a much better mood than before smoking.\\n\\nListening to What a Wonderful World on repeat as I write this review doesn’t hurt. High school high!! \\nI’ve smoked for 35 years and can’t remember being this high since the first time I smoked! \\n\\nThis strain is not for a first time user unless you want to\\nruin the experience of any other strains that come after Wedding Cake as nothing will ever live up to this high! \\n\\nIt’s couch locked, pain eraser, zero f’s given nirvana. \\n\\nI’m a medical patient with a fairly high tolerance and both the flower and concentrate versions of this strain have me feeling no pain and regretting not hunting it down sooner! \\n\\nLet the cheesy, slightly diesely and sweet cherry wash over you like a hug from your pup and then wait for the two levels of “high school high” that will follow. \\nAt first it eases you into a false lull of “oh this ain’t $h!t!”  But about 15 minutes later you start wondering who you are and why is the oven preheated? \\n\\nHeavy body high along with complete pain erasure plus the occasional giggles puts this strain in my top 3 favorite of all time! Gives me a very mello vibe. Anxiety suppression for sure.  I love the sweet earthy taste it has. It just made me hungry and kinda anxious Great tasting and easy smoking. High is clean and clear. Great for social outings where you want to be accessible and engaging. What else could you want?! This strain rocked me the right way. The onset was quick yet the transition was smooth, an illusion of graduation almost. The taste going in is similar to very lightly sweetened moist yellow cake. Very satisfying sensation that promotes utter relaxation and fluid conversation. Interesting to walk around outside during night too, if you ever get the chance. The ground appears to creep away at times, but it overall just added to the intense euphoria. This is a great weekend strain where you can take your time with this one and enjoy your high. Great strain, real top tier no doubt! Really tasteful great smell, a well recommended tier! I’m going to call this one average. I smoked a one gram joint which is usually enough to give me a bit of a buzz and take the edge of my pain. It’s not a bad indica for the early evening to relax and unwind a bit but it definitely wouldn’t relax me enough to get me to sleep. It didn’t do much to my chronic back/hip pain or my horrible menstrual cramps, but did help my nausea. My appetite was not stimulated and my anxiety depression neither worsened nor was much better. All in all pretty unimpressed with this strain. Maybe it’s just the batch, so I’d probably try it again if I came across it, but I wouldn’t go out of my way to buy it. This is by far my favourite strain of all time, it\\'s like smoking unicorn horn okay Seems pretty goooood Bro...roll this up in a Russian cream backwoods and watch scary movie 2. You’re welcome This stuff is awesome! I picked it up from a shop I had never been to before and they convinced me to pick some up. I’m just sad I didn’t get the full ounce!! It’s a very happy and uplifting high. I only rip bongs and it takes 2 hits and I’m flying on this. It is an active one that’s for sure. Wow, this is caught me off guard. This is a very powerful strain and this one knocked me on my ass. This strain is very tasty and smells somewhat like cake, this is gives off a good sedative effect and also gives you a powerful head high, a good mix between the two. Amazing strain very very dank. This Strain Provides An Amazing Head High! Love this smooth and relaxing The past 8 months ive been trying to figure out which strain i feel is my favorite. And today i have come to my conclusion. WEDDING CAKE is #1 Fun high but seriously unpleasant side effect, I\\'m pretty drowsy and when I doze off I jolt to alertness painfully quickly for absolutely no reason. the genetics are wrong.. its not cherry pie x gsc, its animal mints x triangle kush. Excellent! 5 Star Quality 😴🤯😁 does the trick I would deffo say its really creative instead of hungry Made me feel so relaxed and chill felt like I can see into the future My favorite strain, omg I got High with a female friend and we had sex all night long..I would cum and would wanna go another round also gives you some amazing sleep. Leafly would greatly benefit from having a category for sex. Wedding Cake causes some very powerful orgasms, for me. \\n\\nDecent for pain.\\n\\nI\\'m male BTW. Very smooth, good for sleeping. Very good, smooth but not so High. Only had this oil since last night. It’s amazing. The flavor/aroma noted in Leafly is spot on. It gives me a great body high. Everything Stinks a lot, but will get you really high. This help my sleep decently. Uplifting type of high and very tasty ! Definitely one of my favorites ! Dopest dope I’ve ever smoked. Seriously. And I’ve smoked a lot of “connoisseur” grade weed. This strains thc was 29.6 % rocked my socks happy, relaxed, everything positive you could ask for ..I’m high as hell right now. Picked up an 8th of this strain. Man oh man, I had no idea how wonderful this strain smells! Very sweet smelling scent as its name Wedding Cake implies.\\n\\nI would say this strain is a creeper, so take care on taking this medicine as it will either have you energetic & ready to do things, or maybe just sit back on the couch & watch a movie.\\n\\nTakes care of exhaustion, insomnia, depression, arthritis, fatigue.\\n\\nAs far as doing things, it gives you a sense of clarity in order to get work done. Easily able to get into creative mode if you\\'re an artist of any practice Great high I want some Great for pain like very good! Was stressed and anxiety bad to where I would had a scared worried feeling in my stomach. Best sleep ever! Extremely relaxing and I toked it for 3 seconds twice on my Stiiizy which definitely gets the job done. Great job Stiiizy! FANTASTIC Wow! What a treat this strain is! Sweet, full bodied flavor. And the high is unparalleled! So good in all aspects. Relaxing, head and body feel. If I could give it more stars, I would. strong af This is by far one of my favorite strains. You can take two to three pulls and be high. And a nice high. Very good strain to help relax you, and perfect strain to help you focus. trippy Hiiiii!! This is probably one of my favorite strains!! It’s so good and I’m just chilling listening to music having a good time. It’s very relaxing and fun! And the taste was yummy. 10/10. Be safe!! Love y’all Moderate cerebral stimulation. Body high with mild couch lock. Fun to chat and chill. Awesome, a must try. Been smoking weed for a year and a half, Best strain by far! Have Crohn\\'s and tons of joint pain, also fatigue. 1st strain that wipes it all out! not my personal favorite. Still good strain tho. Great for having a relaxed happy bubbly evening. Enjoyed a fun nature walk featuring a case of the giggles, then had an unreal feeling evening watching the sunset while listening to Porter Robinson. This strain helps immense amounts with my anxiety and depression always giving me an amazing high. Tasty, clear head, happy. This one is a great strain cross. Vaped at low temp 310 and really enjoying my evening. This strain is very strong be careful, this is probably one of my favorite strains. First impression after smoking half of a large joint...Weak. I felt a little heaviness in my body, but my mind was still razor sharp. Tried to stand up and did so although I felt like a rock. So I sat back down. Still felt like it didn’t hit my head until my neighbors dog sprinted down the yard and barked. My mind turned its head really quickly, but my head was reacting in slow motion. I feel robotic. Every move a programmed execution of a response. Yes...I am live posting. I am an ambassador for this high. I am on a cloud above thee seeing the world for cool breezes and lightning bugs in the air...87)happy face. Bye. Very cling/relaxing. Heavy on the head and body, but that’s what I was going for. Doesn’t take all my pain away, but it does a pretty good job at dulling my chronic pain to a point that is tolerable. One of my favorite strains of all time. Great vanilla pungent earthy smell to it, sticky and hard to break with your fingers as well. Smokes like a charm too. you can’t go wrong with this strain. Sleepy, but more just chilled out. Not a knock you out but could definately help tip the scales if you’re already tired. Always very tasty, and very strong when done right. Sexy cuddly lazy day vibes I got the wedding cake from Caliva, grown by Flow Kana. Package said it’s indica dominant, this batch had 20.18% thc and 0.06% CBD. \\n\\nI smoked some of this with my bubbler and man it is powerful as hell. Very intense body high but you’re also easy to become energetic from the traces of sativa in it. Certainly good for a chill summer day. Most favorite strain pretty much, fucking always puts me back every hit! Super delicious!! Best wedding cake in the valley of the sun is at Trumed’s dispensary! Testing at 29.3 Thc! Hitter for sure, covered with hairs and crystal trichs One of my favorite strains.  My Wife (non-toker) went to Dockside Cannabis and bought an 1/8 and a pipe for my Christmas gift.  This event was way outside her comfort level, I was and I am impressed with her and the Wedding Cake.  Frankly, it is now one of my go to strains. Love this strain.. everytime I smoke this strain i have a few drinks and I\\'m partying like I\\'m at a club in Manhattan.  This strain is a nice aphrodisiac, gets the moment moving. Love it. Great body high and total relaxation. Ahh. Good ass weed never been happier Decent. But not its predecessors. I had it in a cartridge,  and it tasted like maple syrup. But it was nice after the initial waffle taste surprise. Good high\\nNice and relaxing\\nI like the smell of the bud\\n7.5 out of 10 Super relaxing head high, can also be a giggly / happy high. Relaxing in overall body as well, perfect for a night in to watch a movie / play a video game. Mmmm I got my cake and ate it smoked it and almost left me lunglesss .... clouds clouds I love them MMJ CLOUDS Pretty good, mild high. Decent flavor. Novice consumer beware! This is a super potent strain. I\\'ve smoked 34 years and this is one of the only strains that can do it for me in a couple bong rips. A must try for any contisour! THIS IS THE BEES KNEES!\\n\\nShout it from the rooftops. \\n\\nIt actually tastes like wedding cake too. The taste is so mellow and smooth and inviting. Such an earthy vanilla explosion on your palette. It\\'s an absolute delight to be able to experience this phenomenal and unique strain. \\n\\nI\\'m not saying you should go out of your way to try some wedding cake, but you should definitely WANT to, because you\\'re missing out, bad. \\n\\nWARNING: Will induce fits of munchies! Great effects, feels nice but doesn\\'t glue you down or make you stupid. The only thing that got me was that it tasted like curry? I\\'m smoking it out of a cartridge and it really has a strong turmeric flavor. Not unpleasant, in fact, quite the opposite, but totally unexpected. Overall an enjoyable daytime strain. I got gummies of this strain. It’s a different level of high... I couldn’t open my eyes for straight an hour... and couldn’t move for around two hours... I was melted... if you want to be fucked up, get this strain, otherwise, choose a different one It’s all in the name. I\\'m relaxed not stressed. I don\\'t worry about sleep cause I sleep great. That sleep apnea ain\\'t no joke. Taste so good, and feel amazing It’s Great, good high! I love Indica strains, but they plant my ass in the couch. Many Sativa and hybrid strains give me anxiety, and I overthink. Wedding Cake allows me to enjoying choring on my day off with no bugging, I’m just happy AF and productive!  Thank you to whoever developed these genetics, because this is a golden egg. Very tasty and uplifting. Great chill the f@#& out strain. I had it in sugar wax and it\\'s very intense. Like the first time getting really high feeling. It does make your brain shut off so dont try it if you got stuff to do. Happy chill stress gone anxiety no where to be found very uplifting pretty great. good for pain and walking the dogs I vaped the dab of this strain just now. I\\'m so relaxed I can\\'t move. Love it!! im lovin it so far but ima fan of Thai stick and chocolate thai This is my favourite strain so far. I literally love this so much. Before this strain I didn\\'t know why people had favourite strains and now I do. Such a happy ass vibe to it... might be cause it\\'s called wedding cake haha but I felt this one. Made me feel like I was on a beach somewhere :) It gives me horrible anxiety when smoked at night. Great during the day. Great taste wish i could the the same thing about the high its just made me really tired witch i dont look for i like more uplifting strains Smells earthy, is a creeper. super Stoney with smooth smoke has a nice mellow head high & a nice all over body high and is very relaxing Get this. You need this. One of my favorite strains! So tasty, so uplifting, good for daytime use. Must try!!! This strain has yet to do me long very terpy and tasty. My favorite strain is GSC and this was a great cross bread. Feel very relaxed and muscle pain melted. Recommended before bed or during a day of winding down and recovering. Great strain! Nice taste, a little sweet, a little savoury...and it packs a punch, so a little goes a long way. I was full of energy, but completely relaxed at the same time... and then a little giggly 😊😊 best fucking strain out there Got me decently high. Made me sneeze quite a bit, with almost a peppery taste to it. This hit me beind the eyes. Definitely clouded me. I just want to chill. Mostly a head high. Body high isn\\'t really noticeable other than general relaxation. Nothing too physically sedative. But I have been staring at my phone a few times because I would forget what I was doing. I\\'m just going to play xbox and let it ride. NSFW Best strain I’ve had. It gives me the exact high that I like. Wedding cake has been the only flower I buy since I found it. Taste sooooo good!!! One dab and I relaxed into the couch have a nice body buzz going. Love this strain very chill happy high can\\'t get enough new favorite ever just get tired of wondering if that ones gonna be the one for me look no further this shit rocks. very enjoyable Too dazed It tastes very sweet. Gives an almost instant feeling of relaxation very good strain I\\'m relaxed and happy a good weed for hangouts or outdoors use by yourself or with people One of my personal favorites now! in dab form it\\'s hella dank. I love the high wedding cake gives, a strong Sativa with a touch of jittery distraction, I don’t love how hard this hits. Both times I’ve tried to dab (echo Gemz brand) and vomit from the coughing fits. This one is awesome. Currently 3 hits in on my dab pen and I\\'m pretty focused and goofy. The taste is really good and actually leaves a good aftertaste which is rare. I gotta go study for my psych test so I\\'m hoping this will help. If you’re into relaxing this is for you.  Helps with muscle pain as well.  Once I smoke tho I just wanna lie around and maybe sleep. It’s great if you don’t have any plans!! Amazing. I roll spliffs with raw paper and 2-3 hits I was outta here.. amazing head high in my opinion and slowly goes to the body numb indefinitely. My ideal bedtime strain. 5/5 for me. Happy toking! Tis true about the slight dizziness. But it’s slight. I love this strain. I’ve tried it in preroll, from a bong, and from wax. All very great and relax vibes after. Very uplifting and playful high, girlfriend and I have never giggled and laughed about so much before. So far the best feel good strain I’ve had. Well the batch I am reviewing certainly deserves five stars! This was the first strain in a long time that i have felt the effects instantly after my first puff. I took about two or three hits from a chillum and was properly medicated. Very potent strain, not for beginners. It is a solid hybrid but can be overwhelming and disorienting at high doses.  I will definitely be buying more! Bomb bud, good structure, good smell and taste is on point. Recommend for sure Wedding cake is a marvel of strain engineering.  Buds are frosted with giant, sticky crystal trichomes, and smell of spices and faint sweetness.  The sweetness is more prominent when smoked. \\n\\nIntense relaxation kicks in almost immediately, but the relatively high THC content keeps this from being overly sedating.  Great for those couple hours before bed when you want to relax but not fall asleep right away. It’s good one of he semi regulars in rotation.. though sometimes stronger depending on where bought it’s great for relaxing or just going out Ana walking around target for an hour .. I liken this to a weaker og kushx cherry pie but little weaker Love this! Got this in a cartridge and as a hybrid, wedding cake punch! In SF I\\'m sitting here listening to my old school rap, and as I\\'m bopping my head I decided to write a review. I love. I turned my stereo bass up, and my body\\'s tingling. the music is absolutely 🔥 and I feel wonderful. 100% 👍🏾 One of my favorites! I think it tastes and smells like syrup! Overall makes me feel happier and really zaps my anxiety. I don’t get too tired, and actually want to do things. Love this Smoked a lot of this, most kief I\\'ve ever seen. Relaxed slow but powerful high, physically impossible to smoke this strain and be productive. Very nighttime joint, more for relaxing. I’ve tried this strain with a dab pen (using Space Vape and Alternate Pharms cartridges) as well as smoking it with my bowl and both times being high off this strain was so energetic yet stress free. I am a sativa man myself, but certain hybrids like these still top my personal list. Such a strong high. Tastes really sweet and made me crave cupcakes and doughnuts. If you can get past the initial relaxation this makes you feel, you really can get up and be “productive”. This strain really helped with finding some motivation to paint. : colors were more vivid and music sounded better. I will say I wouldn’t smoke this during the day unless I was going to chill at home and paint or play video games. It helps to knock me out prior to going to bed but tbh the high is so great I don’t want to waste it on sleep. Unfortunately around here only has had it recently and I grab as much as I can. I love cornbread too but wedding cake is my 2019 fave so far this year. Gives me energy for some reason. It’s a great cleaning motivator. Wicked attention to detail lol a little strong for the kids  but all round family friendly I think. Excellent taste great high Jesus man.. why hasn\\'t this strain been forced upon me by my budtenders? I\\'m honestly disappointed!!\\n\\nalright. so I was looking for something cerebral and energetic. when I saw this wedding cake (seen it before when I couldn\\'t afford it) I instantly knew it was what I wanted. really pungent citrus and some nasty chem in there. bright green/orange/some purple/frosty nuggets. I knew this was going to be what I wanted and I was right.\\n\\nthe smoke is forging and tastes like sour chemicals bot not quite that \"cat p*ss\" in my opinion. I think I coughed a few times toward the end of my half gram joint. \\n\\nI was so funny and talkative and I loved everything and everyone. it is amazing for depression! if you can\\'t handle some paranoia or anxiety the. maybe take it easy on this strain but honestly I really didn\\'t feel the usually Adderall feeling I get from strong Durban strains. I usually go lighter like Jack or Diesel for sativas but damn they really perfected the genes o. this bb. so much CHARACTER to this strain which I LOVE!!\\n\\nit might be my #1 strain after I try it a few more times and in more quantity. get some! This is a mellow head high, not a super heavy one. I got up and made food so it\\'s not total glue, and it smells so gooood, i fucking hate earthy smells so this is a good hotbox for me Smooth and effective. Starts out full stativa and as it progresses you get more of the indica. Very uplifting and brought on a good nights sleep. Smoked this in flower form on raw roll up. I like an indica after work. It was not an intense high. I also have a high tolerance. If your just a dabber this will do. Awesome smell and taste.. not super strong so definitely one you can smoke and still get shit done.. \"Wedding Cake\" 21.8% thc grown by Trinity Trichomes out of the legendary mountains in Hayfork, CA. \\nFirst off this flower is an outdoor grow and my 1st time trying this strain, so my review is based off this particular grow. \\nAnyways, The taste of this flower is sweet, kind of floral, maybe vanilla type of taste with a hint of some diesel. Overall really good taste for an outdoor grow. Effects; (i smoked this out of a bong) were a nice, happy, uplifting feeling, very relaxing, yet focused feeling. After getting through about half a bowl I felt  a nice tingly body high, varying in intensity for quite some time which was accompanied by the stoney, spacey, couch locking feelings for a good while. (Like I felt like I couldn\\'t move my legs for about 30 min type of feel) which eventually taperd off into a nice sleepy, relaxed feeling. Overall I think this is a pretty solid strain, i have a high tolerance and i would most definitely not recommend this one to beginners, unless you\\'re smoking small amounts. Well over rated The first time I smoked it, I was fucked. I don’t get as high now but I really like the strain. Strong smell. This is some good stuff, very close to a 5 star rating It has a sweet tast that reminds me of a wedding cake, leave me calm and shelps deal with my ptsd and other issues Currently enjoying it now. I feel so relaxed and so stuck. I love the sweet flavor to it. Excellent strain.  It’s an absolute hybrid but it doesn’t feel like at first.  First came a massive Sativa-like rush almost to the point of too much.  Then the stain takes a wonderful nosedive into Indica land.  Very much a creeper, mild munchies, and settles into pleasant relaxation.  Special First time trying this strain - smokes good and it looks delicious. The buds are sticky, there are multiple colors here, lots of purple, some buds are covered in purp. I do wish it had a sweeter taste like Cotton Candy K. I highly recommend this strain. Gets the job done! Love it. It truly is a hybrid in that\\'s it\\'s the best of both worlds. This really would be some wedding night shit as my horniness was always an element after smoking. I would buy this again and again. Feels like an embodied love. Wedding Cake is one helluva strain! She’s has some wicked crazy terps, a novice could grow her and it would still turn out pretty damn potent and the flowers are always gorgeous with light green, dark green, purple, and almost white when grown properly due to it just absolutely dripping in trichomes. But will someone from Leafly please fix the description of Wedding Cake’s  genetics. It is Triangle Mints(Triangle Kush x Animal Mints) bred by seed junky genetics. It’s special just like that cake on your special wedding day! The buds are compact beautifully, perfect little Christmas trees covered in crystals. Delicious vanilla like taste with a great high to go along with it. Fun bud with the buds Tastes good, it’s harsh, red eyes, dry mouth, very uplifting, very happy, over all very good Great strain with NO anxiety! Smooth inhale, taste earthy/skunky with a creamy finish. The high starts with a faint numbness over the body, a long with a clear-headed cerebral high, that eventually makes you warm and tingly. Overall no racy thoughts, or anxiety. Perfect for night time when you just need a wind down for the night kinda strain.  5 out of 5 for the Wedding Cake! One of my favoeite strains the high is suoer strong but you can still function it also taste amazing Smells sweet! Smokes easy-ish. Feel very focused yet relaxed, but without the couch potatoe feeling. Great, mellow, very relaxing high.  Great taste, look and smell.  Definitely one of my favorite strains. Great starting strain in my opinion Just picked up some $40 1/8 my dispensary Premium in El Centro give me 6 gs for and 1/8 plus they just picked this up from San Francisco it’s still sticky and the smell so amazing the high is instant a head rush if you pack yourself a full bowl out of a 2 foot bong than I mixed with frosted cookies and frosted cookies wax now that was a salad bowl this strain alone is very good fat dense nugs  it won’t disappoint Berner’s growers on point sorry for no punctuations don’t feel like it plus it’s not school lol Last night I got High for the 1st time since about 1986.....\\nWas into the scene during college years, 1978-82. Multiple Dead Shows, etc. \\n\\nThen got married and started a new life which did not include weed. Years go by, kids turn into People, my body aches from past Sports and work, touched by Depression. \\n\\nWatched the Marijuana revolution from the sidelines and finally decided to see if it could help me. So, while visiting my People in DC this weekend, asked them to hook me up, and received Wedding Cake. \\n\\nI figured out the Vape Pen part on my own, loaded the cartridge at 8:45 pm last night (just before True Detective) and took one decent hit. The first hour was truly Bizarre. I had a hard time coordinating my hands, trying to pick up a glass of water was comical. Then my Mind started DEEP analysis, and I mean deep. Had some Paranoid thoughts, but was able to quickly turn them off. By 11 pm, 2 hours and 15 minutes after the hit, things calmed down. \\n\\nThis morning I woke up incredibly well rested. Usually my hip and knee pain wake me up several times. Not last night.\\n\\nMy Current Thoughts-\\nI am looking for Two Things:\\n1. Aiming for Pain Management and help with my Depression.  \\n2. Replacement for Alcohol. \\n\\nDue to how stoned I was last night I doubt Wedding Cake would be a solution for Day Time/Work Time. So I will need to do some research.\\n\\nAs for a replacement for Alcohol...... Yikes I was wasted!\\n\\nI look forward to learning more about the Modern Era of Marijuana!\\n\\nThanks! Great for sex and if you are a guy you will stay hard for hours. When you cum it is incredible and this strain intensifies afterglow. Not the genetics of the wedding cake. Wedding cake is just a pheno of triangle mints. You are spreading so much misinformation sad. I love this strain.  It’s very appropriately named.  \\n\\nLight green fluffy buds with white trichomes.  \\n\\nFull of vanilla terp.  \\n\\nI can’t say enough about the taste.  The after taste particularly, you’d be pressed to find more vanilla terp in anything.  \\nLike eating a piece of wedding cake...\\n\\nThis is likely my favourite.  \\n\\nYou should buy this. This is BY FARRRRR my favorite strain ever! The taste is very sweet and the buds are a dark green to purple colour with this particular grow I got to sample here. It’s an instant winner for me, having a stupidly high tolerance, as it hits hard and hits clean. It’s indica Dom but I feel the sativa effects there in the background, like that friend you know who hovers while you are having a conversation with someone else. \\n\\nThe buds were smelly and tight and when I broke the first bud - which was 4 inches long - it produced a silliage of pine, mud, pastry  and burnt sugar. A wonderful surprise from the straight pine smell from the outside. \\n\\nI love this strain. I haven’t smoked it before so this is an honest first opinion. \\n\\nGreat stuff. \\n\\nI recommend it for calming anxiety at low and slow toke sessions - and for de-stressing and relaxing, roll up a gram raw paper with a glass or raw tip or similar, and fire that bad boy banger up son! \\n\\nEnjoy. Got some drippy wedding cake cartridges from Socal Dabbers. The taste resembled exactly the strain, slightly piney and earthy with a fresh veggie creamy after that (dunno if that makes sense). The high is mildly controllable after first couple hits, if you keep hitting for too long, the high turned more foggy and confusing, which is really bad during daytime but fine at night thought this strain won\\'t make you sleepy. One first hit in the morning should lift you up and got you feeling ready, don\\'t overdo it though or you\\'ll have to cancel your schedule and sit at home watching netflix lol. I SO plan to NEVER get married...but I think I am in LOVE with Wedding Cake! The parents are favorites of mine so this seems like, and was, a no brainer. The taste is incredibly spicy and fruity. It hits quickly and right between the eyes. People kept telling be how bubbly and helpful I was. I did not have the heart to tell them that I was just REALLY high....2019 frontrunner for mONkEy Puff Puff Pass of the Year. I’m smoking this thing right now and I feel good. I’m moving and sitting in a chair watching Boston eat the Knicks bro. I vaped it, try it! literally made dude 💀 off 2 blunts Really like this strain. Had a bit of a Headband feel. Very relaxing. No time warp. Grab a big bottle of H20. This is a potent strain. Rich trichomes and dense buds that will keep you sniffing and sniffing. Imagine a cookie jar being opened and it contains fresh, warm, creamy (chocolate) cookies. Definitely smells like cookies and also a bit earthy. This strain is quite potent and had me locked to the couch in a euphoric and relaxed state for about 2 hours. Comes on strong and glues you to your couch but it is also a clear headed high making you focused and aware. 5/5 - official post. It’s very high in THC and made me a little anxious. Not good for heavy smokers, starts to give you a bad high. Tasty and Stoney! Pretty much, ENOUGH SAID!! Smoked this flower and felt SUPER easygoing and relaxed. It’s a nice smoke! This strain has a great aroma. Effects are heavy, If this doesn\\'t make you happy nothing will. Girl Scout Cookies X Cherry Pie\\n\\n\\n5/5 it\\'s okay I enjoy smoking any kind of strains that\\'s what stoners do 😄 Pretty mellow high, couldn\\'t get a super potent high though. Great for beginners and super mellow. I had been asking about this strain for quite a while before I caved & bought a gram. I have severe anxiety, PTSD, chronic pain & depression, my anxiety is a huge issue in purchasing anything. My budtender told me that he could never form an opinion because it knocked him out! So I rolled one up & WOW😍☺️🤪🤤Great pain relief, no anxiety or paranoia at all, PTSD under control. Tried to watch a movie & dozed off into a wonderful sleep! No night terrors or sleep talking. Needless to say, I’ve purchased more (Curio Wellness in Maryland) & it’s in my top 3 favorites now. One thing about this strain (THC 25.6%), VERY stinky. I could smell it through a solid plastic container inside a closed bag so be aware of that! It’s just really good stuff, highly recommended. My score (0-10): 10 The best high I\\'ve ever had I did not think it could get better than cherry pie... I was wrong. I personally find this to be best used in a practical way. It\\'s what you don\\'t want before an outing, but exactly what you DO want if you need to unwind and/or get some sleep. Very relaxing, great night time or post workout bud. Again, I wouldn\\'t go for this if I wanted to do anything while awake, but would have this on hand again for that much needed R&R. 4 stars for Wedding Cake. I really love this strain a lot !!! It puts you in the perfect mental arena and it is very motivating it actually really works well with my chemo no pain or nausea at all but if your really ill I would stick to the indica strains for true medicinal healing !! I have to say though I truly love this strain especially for people who are having hard time eating this strain gives you the super munchies.....Much Love and prayers to each and everyone of you Very nice mild taste. I don’t like the super strong earthy ones so this was good. Giggled for about 10mins straight and then came down from the high. Didn’t seem like it lasted very long, and the more I smoked I felt like it didn’t have much affect. Overall pretty good, just didn’t last very long for me. One of my top 3 favorite strains. Amazing Wow. All I can say is that I took one hit of wedding cake and felt like somebody was grabbing my eyeballs from the inside, but in a loving way. Very intense, euphoric, pain relieving One of the best strains I\\'ve had. Decided to give it a shot after it was recommended by a friend. Really enjoying it, will recommend and will get again... great up lifting strain ... I wake up with bad anxiety every morning and some strains make it worse but not this one !! put me in a great talkitive mood highly recommend this strain Excellent for day use. Has very uplifting and smooth effect. Still my all time favorite! Gave me a great energy to feel alive and productive. Had a more social feeling while also feeling stoned One of the best I’ve had. Love all the side effects. This strain is marvelous. It is very easy to smoke-- smoothe on the exhale with a creamy feel to it. Its not the most overly terpy bud I\\'ve ever tasted but its got me thoroughly stoned. It\\'s got the vintage cherry pie smell to me, which is very floral and slightly fruity. I feel a focused sense of relaxation throughout my body. This strain has the best flavor I\\'ve ever tasted and has an amazing, tingly body high that\\'ll have you laying in bed with just the right balance of euphoria and relaxation. I would highly recommend this for winding down at night during a family reunion (speaking from experience of course). So it’s the same thing every time I get this strain..the high comes on very strong but if your seasoned smoker it’s the type of high you crave for after getting burnt on trying new strains that are purely trash. Method: Select Oil Vape Cartridge.\\n\\nAroma: Sweet and vanilla-y. Bit bland. 0.5/1 Star.\\n\\nTaste: Like icing and I feel like I can taste a bit of the cherry? Great for a sweet tooth. 2/2 Stars.\\n\\nFeel: Absolute euphoria. At high doses I got a lot of closed eyed visuals. Great for a wedding reception. You cannot hide your high on this though, your eyes will be so red and your mouth so dry. Don\\'t eat Wedding Cake for dessert, severe ungodly munchies. Great for playing in the first snow storm of the season and coming back inside for a hot shower and spa night. 1.5/2 Stars.\\n\\nRanking: Wonderful high but it\\'s way too obvious and I\\'m sure I gained several pounds getting through the cartridge. Won\\'t be getting again.\\n\\nTotal: 4/5 Stars! this strain is uplifting, I can never stop giggling on it Superb, sweet taste. Very relaxing but will keep you social if needed. Makes everything more fun and makes you feel tingly and euphoric. Dabbed some Wedding Cake crumble and unloaded my entire dishwasher. Highly recommended if you need some help to get that shit that you don’t want to do done. Got me frizzled Smoked out of a vape. Never thought I would find a strain that has a stronger affect on me than gorilla glue #4. But this takes the cake. Doesn\\'t paralyze you but puts you in a complete state of relaxation. Have repeatedly gotten the munchies but its not uncontrollable. One of my favorites, but not one I could ever use early in the day. I guess its supposed to have strong sativa affects as well. Never really get a \"bad trip\" from this though, which I have experienced with other sativas. Side note: I can\\'t understand folks who say vape doesn\\'t get you as high. Wedding Cake is one of my favorite strains. I love smoking it and watching movies or playing video games. It’s a pretty sticky flower so it packs in a bowl well. Yummy 😍 good for stress, nice energetic, yet relaxed. Crux good I’m a rush dooxfw Very good smoke. Smells like a dessert or bakery treat and has a creamy flavor with some funk. Very potent Sativa like high. For sure body and mind. Everything is so happy and funny. Hands down one of my favorite hybrids! just like it\\'s parent strain GSC, it keeps me 50/50. The perfect stone for body and mind 🙌🌿🤙🤙🔥 Gave me horrible anxiety and paranoia for hours 😩 I am currently growing this strain. She has medium/broad leaves, and stacks like cookies, with completely frosted classic GSC buds. The aroma of the fresh flower is unlike anything I have ever smelled, it’s so powerful and pungently sweet, I can smell it throughout my house in the last 2 weeks of flower. The mixed purple/red have started around day 35 of flower when it got cold, which made the plant super pretty and it was great eye candy. She likes to be topped in veg, and can take moderate LSTing. If you do it right, she can spread her branches very evenly to give a great SOG. I do SCROG style, which helps the plant steady her branches before flowering, which is probably not necessary, for she makes strong branches that she can hold the buds up herself. The purple/red leaves turned a deep dark purple around day 50, I harvested my first round at day 70, and second round at day 63 and there is no noticeable difference in bud yield, but she is much louder on day 63. Great deep smoke and flavor of cured flower, but my heart lies with the live budder I made with the Cake because I mixed it with 4 other strains, but all I could taste was the Cake! favorite strain hands down. feel really happy and a good head high.  taste nice also. stress anxiety depression pain all gone. great strain for night DO NOT TAKE IF GOING OUT WITH FRIENDS. Me roomie and I planned to go out clubbing and check out a bomb pizza joint. We vaped some of this and those idea went away. She looked like death. She said she didn’t feel like going and she felt super sick and stupid like her brain was mush. A scary dumbest you won’t if you’ll ever get out of it, anyway. I drove the hour back home and we called it a night. I felt horrible. Still do. I don’t trust you Wedding Cake. And it’s not just because my parents just got divorced.. This is straight fire 🔥🔥🔥 Three bong loads over a 20 minute period, watched some YouTube and 30 minutes later, I’m on Leafly writing my first weed review like I’m Gerald Broflovski in South Park writing a yelp review hahah Smoked in a pre roll after a long day at work. Very euphoric, energetic, focused, and relaxed. Amazing! It made me so happy, I couldn’t stop laughing. Then it made me super relaxed. Recommend! Does give hella dry mouth so hydrate tf up. La probé hoy por primera vez y creo que me encanta. Me siento muy relajado,alerta y funcional. Me siento muy cómodo con el toque y creo que se va a convertir en una de mis favoritas \\n\\nToday\\'s test for the first time and I think I love it. I feel very relaxed, alert and functional. I feel very comfortable with the touch and I think it will become one of my favorites my favorite strain. more of a head high than a body high. the taste is amazing and keeps you smacking your lips. a super nice og sent with undertones of fruit this strain is great for just around bedtime when your trying to relax take a couple tokes and watch some tv, this strain is also very relaxing and euphoric the trichome rich dense nugs will have you wanting to take pictures everytime you look at them. im putting this strain on my favourites list good pungent smell hits pretty good too I just smoked this strain and wrote a bunch but deleted it because I’m high and don’t know what I’m doing 🤦\\u200d♂️ but anyways I feel very relaxed, care free, happy, uplifted, focused, and hungry. I feel the perfect indica relaxation effect but also the feel good head High from sativa and probably gonna be pretty tired in an hour or two. Great strain to smoke alone at night. Very relaxing, no couch lock AT ALL, and my bad back pain dissipated, unfortunately strange, my lower back/waist started aching a little bad...maybe because the muscles/nerves were relaxing...idk. Relaaaaaaaaaaxed High. Youuuuu caaan literaaally dooo anyyyythinggggg after taking a few hiiiits of this poweeeerfuuul and taaaasty caaake. Sooo peaaaceful and agaaain Relaaaaaaaxeddd. Just love it. Perfect beginner to the day. Great strain not my favorite 🤷🏽\\u200d♂️ Easy like Sunday morning... except its Thursday afternoon.  I like how it relaxes me, yet allows me to be dialed-in at work. I love this strain, and just found it again after falling in love with it two years ago when I was only able to purchase an 8th cause they were short.  Went all in on it this time and glad I did.  Provides excellent pain control for up to 3 hours on mild day and 1 1/2 hours on bad days.  Will lower my pain levels 3 to 4 continually.\\n\\nFor me, works great for pain, anxiety, depression, insomnia and nausea.  Will purchase again in 24 to 25 pct Thc/ terpine match. noooow then! 10/10! cannot rate this strain enough superb chilled out great tasting smoke. helped with headaches and back pain. Loud af I really love this strain. It\\'s a good strong high. One of the biggest advantage that it has it that everything physically feels good and you feel connected to everything. On a side note I do not recommend while playing earthbound because that freaked me the fuck out. Great overall effect. Expect major munchies about a half hour after indulging. If you are consuming more than a few hits via the flower or oil, expect some mild dizziness. Great social green to share with friends. All I can say is WOW! This strain is great me . It makes my body feel less pain than before I smoked this strain. great for depression too Batch labeled carrot cake, assuming its wedding cake. AMAZING strain. Very heady high, euphoric, almost overwhelming at times. 5 star for sure Thank God for the breeder who brought us wedding cake! I usually get a mild paranoia from bud and have to usually start put with a hit or two and go slow.this strain changed that! I smoked an entire joint in about two minutes and was so incredibly high with no paranoia at all!  whoever made this strain made the best 50/50 calming, hyper aroused,  trippy,cerebral, muscle melting strain there is.  also picked this up in denver Colorado where they put the lowest amount tested and this batch surpassed 32percent thc.  si thinking this was a fluke I hit up two more dispensaries and tries out their version and was pleasantly surprised to have the same effect! if I had to choose one strain for the rest of my life it\\'d be this one for sure!  nothing else compares. It smells exactly like roses and taste very sweet. Most flower taste like smoke to me with a few exceptions but this flower is very  pungent. The high itself I was laughing at any dad joke thrown my way, wouldn’t recommend for day use and something I highly recommend not driving with. A great strain for a night out at a party or club. Kept me nice and and busy. Lovely taste as well. so im gonna give a medical review as i am a patient. I notice a slight appetite increase roughly thirty minutes to an hour after vaping the dab concentrate made from this strain. One medication session is all it took for my pain to ease and my anxiety to exit so I could sleep. The high cbd helps you to sleep and counteracts the negative effects of a high concentration of THC canabonoids. So if you are a frequently stressed person or someone undergoing  chemo and fighting wasting syndrome. This is the bud for you.\\nOne negative is the high THC can make you\" feel couch\" locked after the initial energy buzz fades so try not to be too active and forgetful it packs a punch, \"creeper\" for sure. Becoming a very popular strain in Michigan. This strain has a very good buzz and taste to it that leaves you wanting more. awesome strain! No words. It’s just that good, haha. If my wedding day isn’t as great as this ... she’s definitely not the one. 🤙🏾🙌🏽 I feel relaxed and very happy, zero aniexty! I love this strain! Great taste, real smooth, 10/10 overall lmao. Really good environment. So smooth and leaves such a great high Fantastic Quickly became one of my favorites! Very balanced hybrid, subtle but noticed a sweet under tone to it. Tasted fine, not a fav in that area but still good. The high was just very smooth and balanced, reviewing after having gone through 2 ounces FYI. this is my favorite strain of fl\\n ower bro. The taste is magnificent. This weed gets me high as fuck off of a few tokes. Good Strain. Indica effect. Definitely couch lock strain. Wedding 👰🍰🍽🔔♥️\\n\\nTha taste on this ☝🏽 here amazing 😋\\nNot for a novice 🙅🏾\\u200d♂️ Fight night: Canelo. GGG. Heavy hitters on the scene. Chem Dawg. Death Star. Gorilla Cookies. Ooh. And me, who just didn\\'t want to break it to em that the dankest gal in the room was named Wedding Cake. Mid way through the boring match, they all agreed. Sweet name. But vicious from the first kiss. Really like this!!! Relaxed, content, just nice! Definitely return to this one. I feel like I\\'m in outer space right now so I would say this is some pretty damn good weed Very tasty, some interesting sweet and powerfull in the nose the taste, good strong not too strong, but i recommend use it last thing of your day! One of the best i have tried this year! Oss I’ve been smoking 40 years on and off so when I buy flowers I look for top shelf rather than the 10.00 for 4 gram deals. Wedding cake is extremely cerebral with the ride starting much like headband. My sample is so frosty, that under the scope the trichomes are globs of thc.\\nLong lasting high that does not make you groggy at the end of the ride. Very strong strain. Top 10-15 ever for me. I’ll upload a pic -Extremely relaxing \\n-Chill\\n-Happy\\n-Openminded\\n-Talkative\\n-Overall, one of my favorite strains because of the way it makes you feel\\n-Felt like everything was perfect Strait Gas. this Don\\'t lie This strain gave me a very good high, I would definitely recommend. First time hitting it was in a park and 10 minutes later I ended up in the forest with my friends gathering around a tree. One thing I didn’t enjoy was the earthy after taste, but it hits hard and feels good afterwards. This strain puts me in a good mood, and sometimes makes me hungry. I think this is a great strain. Whoa Nelly, whoa! This strain is the express train to euphoria and it comes upon you easy yet quickly. Lingeringredients on for hours after this is not a beginner strain. This has a earthy unique flavor. Vapes on a medium heat well. Beautiful pink nuggets, dense and bursting with its full flavor! I would say somewhere about an hour in I must of took a nap woke up and had a sudden crave for everything in the kitchen including anything not nailed down. I was relaxed while preparing a meal and getting ready for the evening with a movie and snacks. As you can tell the Munchies are heavy with this strain. It\\'s a fantastic night-time strain. Definitely not a daytime strain. Seriously steer clear of this heavy duty powerful strain in the day, it\\'s far too strong. And all your woes melt away quicly. Pick up extra for a rainy or snowy day and bake some cakes and snacks ... well keep em at hand. Haahaa. Enjoy! Anything with Girl Scout cookies as it’s dad has to be good, right? Smelled of pepper and Clarke’s Teaberry Gum \\nGood for what ached me ; my back , shoulder and also helped with the nausea.\\nJust for kicks the buzz was really nice and it tastes great too After, I went night fishing and caught many strange weird looking fish and a cool turtle \\nI let them all go, cause hey it’s what I do Taste Delicious ... makes you feel amazing , and you will have the munchies . Don’t let the name fool you wedding cake is great all around tasty strain to me personally it’s a perfect mix of sativa and indica it doesn’t knock you out the inhale taste just like wedding cake but the exhale taste like fresh cherry pie stay at home kinda high...lok One of my Favorite of all time now \\n\\n\\nIt’s up there with \\nWhite widow \\nGirl Scout cookies \\nSuper sour diesel \\nWhite rhino \\nJack herer \\n\\nJust to name a few \\n\\nLove how it smells like candy and it stand out with other strain since it’s so white and near pink \\n\\nIt’s a beautiful strain that I really love The smoothest weed I ever smoke.. YES. This is it. Lame got an eighth and it did nothing to me I absolutely love this strain.  Fresh out of LA, my friend after several balls With a little moon rock and we were in an extremely funny world. Everything was hysterical, the energy was amazing, have a nice passin with a little moon rock and we were in an extremely funny world. Everything was hysterical, the energy was amazing, the air was pulsing, friends were chatting.... a fun, carefree energetic strain  with zero in Anxiety  and a smooth, sweet inhsle. Definitely a new favorite! A strain built for festivities. Nothing but wonderful vibes with Wedding Cake. Perfect for smoking with your special someone, because honestly that\\'s as descriptive as it gets. You\\'ll understand why if you try it. I picked on some of this delicious flower yesterday from Haze in San Jose. Their strain packaging I took home had it labeled at 19.84% thc, but as a seasoned daily smoker, this is one of the most potent strains I\\'ve ever had. On the haze website, they mention on that some farms are clocking this strain at 25% thc, and boy that\\'s what it felt like even at 19.84%. This WC had my mind doing back flips!! I was doing a lot of philosophical high level thinking that only high level strains are able to unlock for me. I don\\'t recommend this strain if you have to do anything productive, but just know this strain is a TRIP. Smooth and steady high, great for insomnia! This is a strain that hits you later. After smoking you feel a little head high but nothing much. Then about 20 minutes later you start to feel really relaxed and ready for a nap. I just picked up an eighth of this and I’m impressed. The testing has it at 27.3% THC. Took a big hit off the bong and had to sit down. Hits you as soon as you exhale. Very nice flavor, earthy berries  much like others have said, it has a great head high with a nice stone too. Good for pain but I would not do anything that requires focus. Enjoy! This knocked my dick in the dirt and had me with a big case of the feels.  Vaped this at 90%, this gift from the Gods had me having a heart to heart with my chihuahua Cocoa Bean.   Knocked my husband the fuck out.  Good stuff for insomnia or major anxiety!  Get it and have the best sleep of your life!! I haven\\'t smoked regularly since high school so when my anxiety was flaring up due to college and my body was aching from sports, i started looking for strains that would be mellow enough to not send me to outer space but had the effects to do the job. Wedding Cake is the shit. In small amounts, it performs like any nice sativa. Bit of a swollen head feeling but its super mild, and gives you that awesome happy buzz that makes you want to use your brain and be active. It still gives a nice light body relaxation, but is primarily sativa if youre smoking smaller bowls. The more you light up, the more it acts like an indica and gives you that blanketing body tranquility, but without the heaviness of a true indica. Its an awesome strain, it smells amazing and not skunky in the slightest. Very floral and sweet. Tastes great and smokes sooo smooth.\\n\\nIf youre looking for something that wont put you on your ass or melt your mind, WC is the one. To be fair, I\\'m a CBD girl.. but growing this.. it is a beautiful plant.. with the right pheno.\\nPeople seem to really like it. Taste good When of the best connoisseur. I felt very happy the whole time. Tried it with a friend he said he has never had a better strain. Loose buds, low thc I myself have tried this strain and it makes me very dizzy with a flagrant headache. I rename it Birthday Cake because it’s my birthday!  It tastes like cake and knocks a much needed pause in your life. YAASSSS Smells GREAT! Smells just like wedding cake. Relaxed, carefree, lifted This wedding cake !!!!!!  Is a blessing from God himself. This is a great high. And if you have SEX on it be ready to get pregnant cause the juices will be flowing like a white water rafting river . This is a great high it puts you in a amazing mood . And you will just want to be touched. Like you’re on cloud 9 getting literally what ever you do it feels good doing it. So far the best strain I’ve smoked.\\n\\nI get anxious easy when I smoke weed and my adhd usually speeds up that problem.\\nThis is not how I feel when I smoke wedding cake. So far it has been a great help dealing with my stress and feels me feeling light, sparkly, and comfortable.  I ack goofy and “geek”out when I smoke usually.  but this weed makes me feel like I can slow down and articulate my ideas better. \\n\\nThis isn’t going  to be the best weed for those who want to experience a heavy head-high sativa, or those who are want to be sprawled on the floor relaxed off a heavy indica. But the two elements come together in a unforgettably smooth mixture. Very tasty strain. It made me more talkative, giggly and overall happy, chill mood :) This strain is hard to find in Florida which makes me sad because this is probably my favorite hybrid. I haven\\'t had a strain taste so closely to it\\'s name. I bought this as cheesecake and it honestly tastes like cake. the rated affects are spot on accurate. great for afternoon focus or relaxation best I\\'ve had The taste of Wedding Cake is so sweet and potent that I just want to keep smoking it. By the third hit I could feel more of an indica high setting in. Definitely one of my favorite strains, and I would recommend picking some up if available. How could I forget the taste of this strain?! Super sweet tasting almost like berries or a cake! This stuff had me trippin. Reminds me slightly of green crack how it makes colors super vibrant grass looks amazing! Spent most of the high outside and the Californian sun feels like a warm blanket wrapping you up! Probably one of my favorite strains i\\'ve smoked! A little paranoia at first but eventually clears up and gives off a happy uplifted high. Real smooth, I like that. ::::Alien Labs::: \\nPerfect after work strain to enjoy!  Made me very relaxed and feel good.  Tastes like sweet vanilla to me.  The flower itself smells sweet too.  The bud was light green and purple and very frosty with trichomes all over.  Definitely get the alien labs one if you can!!!! Now what a different blend of fun this one is! A kind of tart marzipan flavour awaits the user bringing a dank hit, chesty but smooth. Not a choker, this is next gen bud that questions \\'how have they grown that?\\' Marks the revolution of recreational herb! This one will go down history, smokers in 20 years will remark on Wedding Cake! I have the dreamcake strain which is wedding cake And another crossed. but shit is bomb. good for blunts and beautifully perfect nugs. Okay so let’s see, it gives a very good high. \\nIt’s yummy lol the taste isn’t harsh nor is the smoke,  it’s very smooth & a little sweet! It creeps on you though but not like a crazy high, you can literally tell that you’re getting high (noise becomes very soothing) it’s like you’re sitting on a very soft couch lol I’m clearly on a flight right now. But anyways yeah that’s it Crazy how no one on this review is honest and tells you how this strain makes your head hurt Some straight gas!! I felt like the Detroit piston mascot on the exhale blowing straight flames out of my nose 🔥⛽️ but on the inhale, sweet smooth vanilla terps!! shout out to the TLC collective and the Jungle Boys for killing the game with this strain!!! Good strain5/5 This is my all time favor strain! I use medically mostly for depression and anxiety. Unfortunately, sometimes when I get high I get thoughts that I can\\'t escape. Most strains will cause my thoughts to consume me if I go even a little hard. But, not this stain. Wedding Cake is my magic pill. It completely washes away my depression, anxiety, and OCD. I have not had a bad high with this strain. It has helped me to have a new lease on life. I\\'m just afraid the dispensary I got it from (Theory Wellness) won\\'t do another run. I would be willing to buy ounces of this strain! It’s very relaxing. I picked up a nice fresh quo of this strain. Right away the smell was incredible! moment I snapped the bag open the smell was wonderful, and extremely strong. Within 30 seconds of dumping out the contents of the bag the room smelled strongly of good weed. After taking a 1g joint to the face, it was safe to say that I was incredibly high and very relaxed. Despite being very relaxed, I didn’t feel sleepy or an urge to close my eyes. My high was very relaxing and stress free, with a touch of energy. The only downside was my extreme case of dry eyes. Which were fairly red. 4/5 strain Very strong and trippy strain!\\n\\nPacked a bowl into my bong, thick and kinda tasty smoke...The high crept up on me while packing another bowl and after a few minutes of being spaced out I put the bong down lol. Super happy, feel good sativa high and a mellowed but not couchlocked body. Great for daytime! INCREDIBLE- full body buzz... straight-up stoner! The 1/8th I purchased 2 days ago (8/8/18) was the last of it at my local shop. Labeled as \"Triangle Mints Flower\" by Jeffery, somehow associated with Northwest Pearl... this is very powerful weed! 29.50% THC 0.09 CBD Mostly Indica I would say, but loaded with plenty of giddy-up as well. Perfect mid-day snack! Sweet little thumb sized nuggets really stick to the finger while cramming them in my grinder. and then yea, wham bam awesome! Yow this is ONEADAY and trust me this is a n awesome strain. The aroma when breaking it up and the taste💨.....Wedding Cake is straight🔥\\n\\nGets 5 stars from me This is probably top three for me. I should have got a lot more than I did when I came up on it.. next time I know better! Very great strain. great euphoric head high...amazing...very chill flower..vet with tons of medical issues and this calms my head and physical injuries.. 2018-08-02 oil tk extracts, wedding cake, extra strength, thc 91.8% cbd 0.49% cbn 1.02% Had this flower dipped in oil and keif, wow. What a lovely high. It was a clear summer night, my friend invites me over for a smoke session. Without hesitation I humbly accept the invitation. Upon arrival all that is there, my friend, a mocha Dutch wrap and two strains of magnificent bud. The base strain: wedding cake and the topping: XXX OG. As I gut the mocha warp my heart races ready for a good high, I remove the bud from it’s containment and grind up about a solid gram of wedding cake. As I’m getting ready to roll I thought to myself and brought up to my friend. “This is a waste” referring to the 1 gram blunt. And he goes “what do you mean” and I say “we need more!” I believe the pungent smell of the wedding cake was teasing my mind. So both without saying anything we knew what to do. I added a pinch of XXX OG (.5) and rolled a beautiful pearled blunt I possibly could. After admiring the beautiful blunt we continued to the smoking spot. Saying a prayer, then sparking up the B we come across a whole new experience. We both are used to smoking quite a few blunts at one time and then maybe some bong hits but in this case it was different, special indeed. As we neared the end we’re both looking at each other thinking “can we go on?” We we’re both blowed and amazed that we could achieve such a high with just one blunt. Once finished we both just wanted to go inside and munch on some snacks. Not even 40minutes in we couldn’t help but starting to drift off into a relaxation so deep we wanted to sleep but wanted to enjoy it at the same time. I fight between wanting to play Xbox or go to bed was the struggle faced. As the hour neared we both slept like fat babies only to wale up and smoke again and go to the mall. Long story short we got really high on one blunt. 10/10 recommend, would do again. Probably the strongest strains I’ve had. For me it beats green crack. Smells just like cake , vanilla frosting , The aroma of Wedding Cake, as others have said, is very sweet and reminiscent of a cupcake. The flavor is also sugary and unique, which I found a little off putting. Being a fan of indicas (especially purples) and India-dominant hybrids, maybe this was my threshold for sativa and the new cookie craze in cannabis users. \\n\\nOverall, because of the effects, I can see why this bus is so popular. It is definitely a daytime smoke and allows the user to be medicated while continuing to function in public. After picking this strain up, I read the reviews before I smoked it. Im a decent smoker and this one really surprised me, Every comment hit it right on the head. Its such a great, calm, body high. Definitely a very creative high. Definitely recommend doing some kind of activity while on this strain. Massive Attacks album Mezzanine did it for me! By far my all time favorite strain! Beware though it is DANK!! I am a long time smoker (3 decades) and Wedding Cake is best I have ever had! Happy and full of Energy but not a bit paranoid. Euphoric but not giggly. A great high! Lovely mid day smoke one of my favourite tasting buds propa sweet, leaflet has the genetics wrong they are actually triangle kush x animal mints not sure where they have got CherryPie from Ho lee chit! So excited to see Wedding Cake pop up as a featured strain! My last few flower buys were strictly Wedding Cake by Little Hill Farms. \\n\\nIt\\'s a full scale, physical melt. So slippery good on the body, and very mind-calming. The go-to for leaving it all behind, and floating into the night.\\n\\nI tried twice to smoke this during daytime activities (moving!) Nerp. A 4-hour nap with moving truck parked outside = no bueno. Use sparingly or as a mixer or topper. Seriously! Hearing wedding bells? Used Concentrate for Pax era pen\\nTastes like pinesol cleaner but with a two puff toke I can taste a bit of the cookie/cake/frosting on second draw\\nAlmost immediate heart rate increase (anxiety feeling) for about ten minutes\\nWarm water rushing through limbs\\nHeavy body\\nCan still read and write!\\nCannot go for a walk because my legs won’t cooperate \\nStill need to do more testing though..... Kinda flaky, very strong, harsh on your throat. Super good. Grinding this bad boy up released some phenomenal scents. It is so reminiscent of that GSC taste, with a fruity twist that screams cherry, whilst maintaining that OG earthiness.The frosty nugs themselves are so visually appealing that this strain has been on my list of must-haves for the past year. It\\'s strength is immediately noticeable, reducing pain levels dramatically within the first ten minutes, whilst leaving me mentally agile. This makes Wedding Cake a great day smoke, but due to its\\' strength, I would caution users who are prone to paranoia. This stuff makes me feel anxious right off the bat. It’s strong as hell and makes things sound cool, but I don’t wanna have to take anxiety meds cuz I’m was chillin and didn’t expect the thing that was supposed to be fun and chill make me anxious. Ugh gotta wait for it to wear off now A great four star strain. I took it in the form of shatter that a buddy put into a cartridge for me, so I could medicate on the go. If you’re like me, then you may also be a fan of vape pens and trying all the strains to really see what’s the best for a quick on the go, portable concentrate dabbing/vaping.\\n\\nThat being said, Wedding Cake isn’t a strain for the morning or day. I mean honestly, you can smoke any weed at any time and be fine, it’s just about dosage. One hit of this in the morning will just leave me feeling ultra comfy. That’s not so bad for me, since i naturally wake up slowly. But any more than a couple hits and I’ll want a nap. I actually keep it by me at night in case I wake up because it’s so effective with putting you in a sleepy state.\\n\\nOverall this strain isn’t special. It’s pretty simple and left me feeling ultra relaxed within five minutes of a hit, and it also gave me a good night of sleep. No visual tripping, no anxiety, no munchies, just a pretty one dimensional high. Then again, all Girl Scout Cookie strains, except for Thin Mints, plateau at a 7/10 high for me, or they are one dimensional. Kush strains are hit or miss for me too. Half are phenomal (like Purple Kush) and others are usually pretty boring for me (like OG Kush). I haven’t figured this out yet, but if you’re like me you’ll find similar results probably. If you love GSC strains, you’ll LOVE this. Stay lifted 🤙🏻 Keeps me busy, but chill.  Long lasting buzz.  Can’t go wrong! sweet, sticky buds that taste like fruit. inhale is smooth but too big of a hit will make you cough.\\nReally good. I usually prefer sativa but this is a great medication for depression, aches, and anxiety.\\nmuchies and red eyes. have something to drink on hand, cotton mouth. Bought some of this from TLC in L.A. and I must say jungle boys are legit! Tastes like vanilla cake at the end of exhale nice body high but I can still think clear and get a task accomplished if need be. 5/5 Wedding Cake is delicious, as the name suggests. This strain helps me communicate better with my significant other, but that doesn\\'t mean she agrees with my schemes. WC enhances the sense of pleasure, and brings vivid dreams of beautiful scenes. Obviously, as you can read, WC inspires creativity in the form of bad poetry, but in such state of bliss, who cares about this? So to be ironic, some mellow fellows and I smoked some wedding cake before eating wedding cake at a wedding where the wedding guests were also eating wedding cake.\\n\\nWhat a glorious thing, wedding cake. \\n\\nEmbrace the cliché, this is now my absolute favorite strain.\\n\\nHow I ended up with a random wife, idk. I sample lots of strains being in a legal state. This one seems special.\\n\\nThe Wedding Cake I got doesn\\'t taste sweet like most are describing, it\\'s predominately dank- spicy and earthy with cookie and durban twinges. It reminds me of GG4.\\n\\nThe effect is a ideal for me. This feels purpose built for whole body relaxation, I felt a noticeable drop in anxiety. Not much mental stimulation, possible couch lock incoming. \\n\\ngoodbye Burns a tiny bit at first but this is really good. Pretty tasty, smooth smoke, relaxed and cheerful, a nice easy ride, makes me lazy though, so smoke after everything is done.., AKA Pink Cookies this strain is worth enjoying when you come across it. Buds are amazing. Dense, dark green & dark purple in color & are covered in bright dark orange pistils with crystal trichomes. Scent & flavor was interesting kind of a sweet & spicy. Effects made me happy & euphoric followed by relaxation without being sleepy unless i over smoked or it was the end of my day. Indica dominate with 18% THC.\\nPeace ecaeP It was a nice strain took a lot to get you high but it was a nice mellow high This strain is so delicious it really taste like birthday cake and gets you right. Be careful though this is a powerful strain so if your not really into heavy hitters you might want something else. It’s a very pretty and crystallized bud!!! I absolutely love this strain. You definitely smell that pepper it\\'s strong but when you smoke it I feel like you can taste the sweet & tangy and it all swirls into this savory gentle union. The physical effects, \"it feels like when the water from the shower first touch your skin\". I\\'m relaxed , euphoric , inspired , numb , tingly. I think this is going to be an all-time favorite for some. I just got finished taking a few (4 hits) hits from the bong 10 minutes ago and I tell ya, this one creeps up on ya. At first the taste is sweet and vanilla in a sort of way. My body feels relaxed. Head feels like a balloon, but with just enough \"helium\" that it does not feel too tight. Overall I\\'m feeling really relaxed and happyand enjoying the ride. Have a great morning,evening,or night to whom-ever is reading this. Home run in my opinion, for a person that suffers from constant pain (joint disease), I feel ZERO pain in my ankles and knees, focused and for some reason cannot stop smiling, Zero pain and feeling good, Perfect after or during a stressful day, The taste has a unique pepper undertone with a hint of vanilla, left a very pleasant aftertaste in my mouth, the smoke was smooth as silk, I vaped, spooned and Grav Lab 2 foot glass bong smoked this choice product, smoke was righteous, not harsh and had a pleasant complex after burn smell, This is that weed that makes you so happy that it’s almost impossible to have a problem. This is definitely an uplifting smoke with a sense of irresistible sexual delite to follow but keep the chocolate close because that is a pit stop along the way amazing strain I would recomend this to anyone who like their GSC and likes dense crystaly budz Amazingly pretty as it is tasty. Good mellow buzz that definitely takes the bite off of a long day of customer service.... you know, the first ring of Hell. Would be an immediate reco for anyone looking for a new strain to turn into their daily smoke. Kiefs really nice too so it’s the gift that keeps on giving on that level. It hits hard and you only need 4 hits and it will creep up on you. Total buzz all around. No pain in my lower back. Will be getting more. Easily my top 5. Super stoney. I find it great for late night relaxing and not so much for getting stuff done. kinda makes me nod, ha ha. Great for contemplating anything. I always had problems eating and this makes me want to eat. WoW! Just vaped some, and it tastes like a hazelnut cake! I\\'ve found this strain to be a great body high, very relaxing, and you may have some naughty impulses regarding your significant other. Comes on nice and blissful and tastes lovely, kinda like you fell into a vat of warm maple syrup. Recommend for those that suffer from anxiety brick laying (if you have it, you get the analogy). This is one of my favorite strains.  Amazing flavor, sweet and pungent, really stoney with a relaxing predominately indica feeling high.  This product from Phat Panda was all around excellent. this was by far one of the most fun experiences I\\'ve had with any strain I took two bong rips and I was extremely high it was a very relaxing high but also reminded me of what it\\'s like to be drunk I would recommend this strain to anyone Nice heavy purple flowers, with orange hair coated in white crystals. Smooth and sweet going in and a hint of cherry on the exhale. Wife and I were able to sample this lovely strain on our last visit to Trinidad Colorado ( our favorite little piece of Colorado thus far ) While blissfully inhaling I felt as if a warm blanket had been pulled down over me from head to toe, we slipped into our night with a smile on our faces, happy in our choice. Definitely in my top 20..... one of the best strains. get a happy high that is light and breazy. good strain for smokers with high tolerance. great classic chronic taste Good bud, smoked a few joints while I worked on some essay assignments. Felt relieved from stress and clear-headed while feeling a nice body high. Had no problem finishing my essays. Love the taste, and great energy for being relaxed but up and getting shit done. Wedding Cake is outstanding. That is all. Great strain it shmacks  the fuck out of me. Great time with hella tricombs. Super sticky. First off, Wedding Cake is NOT GSC x Cherry Pie.\\n\\nThe true genetics are Triangle Kush x Animal Mints.\\n\\nThis is a great strain that tastes phenomenal. This strain is amazing. By far my favorite at this point. Even has a wedding cake after taste. We love it! Description is true to its word I may be one of the few that thought this strain was just, \"Eh.\" However, I usually enjoy something a little more indica dominant than this one. I thought the taste left a little to be desired. Maybe the name threw me off. I expected something a little sweeter. This was more like one of those weird white cookies covered in powdered sugar at my creedy Aunt\\'s house in the 80\\'s.   This strain will relax you and give a nice stoney feeling. But I wouldn\\'t say it did much for pain or tremors. Damn tasty! it is a creeper so watch out. but it gives you a nice calming feeling, where u just wanna throw on sum tv n chill. I\\'m not very productive w this strain lol, so 2 me it\\'s more 4 relaxing and winding down. enjoy I don’t know if it’s an sativa dominant strain or if it really does creep on you like people say. 😂😂 I smoked a few days ago & I guess I fell asleep but when I woke up I didn’t remember falling asleep. And yesterday I fell asleep right with the phone in my hand!! Hilarious 😂 Immediate relief. I had been going through a bout of strains that just weren\\'t getting me right - this one got me JUST where I needed to be. After one bong hit I had immediate anxiety relief and stress relief. This is one for those who need to take the \"edge\" off from life and just want to relax. You can get lost in your favourite TV show or go on an endless YouTube marathon with this one. Absolutely love this strain. After taking a few hit i always feel so awake and energized. One of my all time favorites! Great taste very clean and flavorful. having had this strain 3 weeks off the vine it was so fresh. hits hard but in a smooth way working it\\'s way up to a great high! I love it!! Taste like cake Smoked on this strain earlier and it made me feel so relaxed. I cooked a big meal and took suchhhhhh a great nap. Definitely would recommend this for stress or people that need something to help them sleep. Definitely a indica leaning strain. However I still have the groove to go for a walk. Wedding Cake has to be one my favorite strain EVER! It hits me right away from one bowl, and I instantly felt relaxed. It’s more of a physical high for me with intensified sensations. After smoking this, my mind feels very cleared. \\n\\nI would say this strain is extremely potent so beginners, be careful. \\n\\n\\nOverall, love love love this strain! very good long lasting high not to strong amd it leaves a nice after taste in your mouth..I would recommend this strain for like nature walks and hikes I am not a fan of GSC,  but this strain is just so special.  For me,  it taste very sweet and fruity.  Like fruity loops cereals.  \\n\\nHigh is a very strong sativa high.  Maybe I will try to swim after smoking these. I hope that I won\\'t be drowned.\\n\\nUnless you only want something that knocks you out,  indica lovers should give this a try as well.  I am an indica person. This strain smells and looks gorgeous but it didn\\'t knock me out like I was expecting. Still good! Would try again. Mild High great outdoor activity strain As implied on my name I love this shit. Smoking this shit through a pipe will hurt but it leaves that sweet taste in your throat for at least two days. While in this strain I experienced mass relaxation and even to a point where my friend just passed the fuck out. Listening to music makes the experience ten times better as usual and god damn it gives me a sweet tooth. Have cherry pop tarts on deck for best food or watch The Eric Andre show or Reading Rainbow. I have no idea why but it’s fucking amazing. Smoked a big bowl of this after getting some Starbucks and forgot about it in the other room for an hour. This strain smoked relatively smooth and had a pleasant floral aroma. This might be an excellent strain for stress related disorders like anxiety and PTSD. Negative feels come up and and Wedding Cake is like BAM💥 gtfo my house. Paranoia level: 2/10. Super relaxed and comfortable high. I was feeling very irritable and anxious before smoking and within 10 minutes I was feeling the full effects of its relaxation. There is definitely a fairly noticeable tingle of a body high as well accompanied by heavy eyes and dry mouth but for anti anxiety, depression and stress I would highly recommend. I don’t feel tired BUT I haven’t left the place I sat to smoke either lol Delicious taste of strain after a waffle breakfast meal. Mellow feeling and my back pain is where???? IDK I love the smell of it on chilly day. I didnt like the smell at all while all of my friends loved it, it smells sweet but there\\'s also a sour? note that I personally find clashes and smells disgusting.. Besides the smell the strain is amazing, it tastes great. It helps a lot with any nausea I might have Nice body high.  Very relaxing.  Adds a nice touch to sex. This is some premium dank weed. When I first caught a whiff of it I thought it was dog poo. It was so earthy pungent. Definitely true to its hybrid form, it\\'s got the best worlds of indica and sativa. No couch-lock, helps with focus and relaxation while contemplating the cosmos. Best High I have ever had.. hands down! I\\'ve looked for this a long time ago and couldn\\'t find it. Until now, I highly recommend this if you are looking to go somewhere through music and space. Amazing I have 3 categories of cannabis in my head\\n\\nMake Pain Go away \\nGo to Sleep \\nGet high \\n\\nThis goes in the third category \\n\\nThis particular strain was pretty strong for me sitting at around 21 percent  or more. It smelled really good which is why I got it from the store. It sort smelled like orange juice in the jar. When I smoke it all tastes and smells the same to me but as a flower this smells superb. \\n\\nI felt a really cerebral high that left me kind of stupefied but feeling good. The smoke was also very smooth. It didnt burn my throat with a type of pungency like alot of other strains. \\n\\n\\n So for those reasons I think it will always be my new \"go to\" for a \"get high\" flower. An overall great smoke. Measuring a little over 23% It’s easy to fall in love with Wedding Cake. From the time you see the bud and see all the crystals you know you’re in for a great smoke. This can easily be a mid day smoke or you can let it be your relaxation/sleep smoke. Either way works like a charm. I feel like I’m floating. This is amazing. It’s strong as fuck. In both smell and high. Smells beautiful. Weedy but not unbearably pungent. Sweet smelling actually. This is the best high I’ve had in a while. This is definitely something to put my friends on to. Holly crap is this amazing strain with the perfect name. I was sitting in my bed vaping this bud and suddenly started wondering when I had cake. This bud tastes exactly like a cake, its crazy. I have a cold and can\\'t smell well, but the vanilla... It just punches you square in the face. The best tasting bud I have ever had.\\n\\nWell, enough with all of the chit chat, let\\'s get real here. This bud is strong. A perfect choice for an evening smoke after a long hard day. I don\\'t get much uforia from this bud, but I just feel amazing. The high comes on gently, but slowly starts to build to a very powerful hybrid. Perfect for the evening smoke, this bud keeps your muscles feeling strong, and your mind feeling chill. This is definitely one of my new favorite strains for depression and anxiety, I can just lay down and hang out. Along with helping with my depression, this bud is incredible for my ADHD, I am able to type this review much faster than normal, and the words are literally just pouring out of my hands.\\n\\nDefinitely one of my favorite strains yet. And again, BE WARE OF THAT VANILLA!!! A smooth, body high that smoothes out any anxiety and jitteriness I love how relaxed this makes me feel. I slept very well. Definitely indica dom for me. The Bilest Thing I\\'ve Smoked, Would Definitely Like To Get It In Wax Or Shatter We feel relax I feel less stress right now also kinda happy too more  be right now focused kinda smoke less 3 maybe 4 hit from the gravity see long it last till the another Phenomenal for relaxation. But be careful as there is a bit of weight to it. Not a strain that’ll put you down for the count, but it isn’t going to be ideal for activities. \\n\\nAs the bud tenders put it... “the best smoke you’ve never smoked”. Now if relaxation with a good hint of euphoria and clarity are your thing, this will definitely deliver. Feels like my body is being weighed down heavily, but evenly distributed across every single inch of my skin. The Durban in this one will definitely keep you up though. Highly recommend this to the heavy smokers, it’ll break that tolerance real nice 👌 enjoy!! 1 of my favorite strains.. has a great taste, and it gives you a super nice high that gets you super comfy..\\nI give it a 8 out of 10 stars Really great. Relaxed but not sleepy This hybrid showed strong indica influences and it really makes you focus. Great to smoke and watch movies and shit I like Wedding Cake a lot. It’s a nice slow gradual high that eases you into a relaxed state of mind. Definitely a good strain for my anxiety and back pain. 10/10 would smoke again This strain is an awesome hybrid. Gotta rep Washington DC on this strain and every one I try cause they need to be on here. Dank smell with great color and rich flavor a must have in the heady stash. this one hit on the trifecta of radness! tastes awesome, looks amazing, great high! if you see it, get it! What a amazing strain it hits so hard and gives a amazing high....literally after one hit from my bong I was stoned 🙃100% will buy again I really liked this strain a lot, It was a nice gradual high that didn’t hit me like a train but was still strong enough to relax definitely would smoke this again Phenomenal strain. Totally a white wedding cake. Very floral top note that characterizes the pre-smoked or vaped bud, sweet slightly berry inhale with creamy vanilla on the exhale. If you vape this the final product tastes and smells like kettle corn! Amazing stuff and leads to a calm, focused, and euphoric high. Loved this strain. Great balanced high & not to tired. I use it during the day. I find Im relaxed yet I can still function & accomplish task. Will defiantly get again. by far hands down best strain ive ever smoke. ive never smoked a strain that got me high quicker than this one. HIGHLY RECOMMEND very strong. just a couple hits keeps me good for a long time This is the best strain I’ve had man my whole body locked up on me lol. In a good way though Finally got my hands on this strain after wanting it for a while it\\'s actually good as hell glad I found the dispensary it\\'s just making me talk a lot lol but other than that it seems like its really good for depression makes you have good vibes. source of the concentrate makes a good trim run shatter. overall was a pleasant experience. only thing I would take into suggestion when wanting to try this is is you have anxiety disorders be careful and start small either flower or concentrate. because Mercyne is high in cherry pie though GSC does have elevated CBG which has many great anti inflammatory properties and ani anxiety. Wedding cake could causes some mild paranoia for some. Everywhere I look online says that wedding cake is a cross between girl scout cookies and cherry pie but after doing research on jungle boys, it seems as though their wedding cake is a mix of animal cookies, thin mint cookies, and girl scout. whatever it is, it is great strain. It comes in around 30% thc and around the same percentage for rosin and BHO yields. It provides a great euphoric high that had me sitting in the barber shop high as hell. Definitely a strong sativa with great uplifting effects. Love it and will be buying again soon. saw this the other day, so got a half ounce of it and decided to make it into some budder. \\nmade the first batch of some edibles, ended up having to reaheat and add more regular butter to tone down the potency. LOVE this strain, definitely one to add to the list of favorites Fucking amazing. Great head high and gets the sex drive going. Tastes like vanilla icing. Need I say more?! Another great Cookies strain. Very similar to Sunset Sherbet and Gelato with that complex sweet smell that makes it easy to see why these get named after deserts. Has similar effects to other cookies strains as well, powerful, calming cerebral trip with a couch lock body high the more you smoke. Definitely worth checking out for another super potent hybrid. 4.5/5. Description is true to word! Worth the extra money! And perfect smoking experience Had it today sep.18.17. itz .coo. i like the high. 209 cail . it\\'s me and my husband\\'s 13 year anniversary today and we wanted to get something to smoke together. this was a great choice on this special day. we smoked a gram joint while staring out at the waterfront watching boats and seagulls and jellyfish and other weird creatures that we\\'re still not sure we really saw. I blanked out for about a minute contemplating whether that jellyfish was really an octopus. because that\\'d be cool. so yeah. recommend. now we\\'re eating tacos. Jungle boyz wedding cake is to die for. Scooped some from house of dank in Detroit and this continues to be my fave! Perfect taste just like sweet cake, mellow chill high, and very relaxing! Must have for any top shelf smoker. I\\'m one of those people that\\'s hard to please and this is the first strain that has given me the feeling I\\'ve been searching for. It\\'s chill but still kicks my ass. I don\\'t get the munchies or any anxiety. I just took a .2 snap out of my lil roor stemless bong and this strain really brings out the best of Girl Scout cookies and cherry pie. It has that signature pungent doughy smell Girl Scout cookies has with a frosting like twist and also has a hint of sweet candy berry with peppery earthy OG undertones. Strain smells delicious and hits hard like a OG delivers a very relaxed stoney body high with a focused euphoric sativa high but after a couple of hours it settles into a full on body stone but still functional. Good for creative activities and people who want pain relief but don\\'t want to be couch locked. Smells and taste like absolute heaven. Super mellow and delicious I thought it smelled divine, I caught myself a few times, just smelling the container it came in because it was so good. I didn\\'t get a \"super stoned\" feeling, I was however relaxed and didn\\'t get too much of the munchies. \\n\\nI honestly was a bit more forgetful than usual with this strain, asking myself what I possibly came in the room for or what it was i needed to do.\\n\\nsmelled good, taste good. The smell is loud!! You can really smell a cake scent. When smoking, felt so warm on the inside as I slowly just drifted into bliss!!! One of the best strains I\\'ve smoked and gets you high really well. Would recommend to everyone to try at least once. the rating of one star is not for this strain, but this strains description.... wedding cake is not cherry pie crossed with girl scout cookies Leafly couldn\\'t be any more incorrect. wedding cake is a strain breededed by seedjunkys Jay bz and alien labs witch is a generic crosse of triangle Kush x animal mints.... couldn\\'t be more off in this one..... Wedding cake is a fantastic strain. It gives you a great high. You can hit this and go on a quest outside or stay in and watch a good show. Its light on the body and gets your mind going. Good size buds and its sticky. This is Easily top three strain! Although being an avid reader of strain reviews, this is surprisingly my first ever review. That should tell you how good this strain is... when done right, of course. High THC strain that is mostly labeled as indica, but is the perfect hybrid in my opinion.  Heavy handed euphoria can be found here... Possibly from the Durban Poison heritage? Seems to be a hard to find strain. Medmen in Santa Ana has high end quality version, if you\\'re willing to pay top dollar. Would highly recommend this strain! Great bud. Smoked a bowl and in seconds relaxed. Very pleasant smell. I don\\'t like loud herb. The taste was sweet to me. Would smoke it again 5 out of 5 every single time! The buzz is electric! Can get things done all while giggling and alertness. Tastes so damn good too. There\\'s a reason it\\'s called wedding cake. Cause it\\'s the best damn cake you\\'re ever gonna have. I heard it was animal cookies×triangle kush. Two bong hits, two hours later I am so tired.  Like, I can\\'t keep my eyes open.  I am going to bed a full hour earlier then I am used to.  So this strain is great for sleeplessness. Me though, I need something a bit more uplifting and euphoric. The perfect strain for anxiety and pain. The taste isn\\'t harsh and the relief is sustained with positive effects. One of my favorite strains for sure. All the good sativa effects plus all of the best indica effects! A life enhancing bud with a great flavor. smoking a blunt of this at the moment.... smooth taste, somewhat sweet. Heavy hitter, very strong anf very high in THC. I give it a thumbs up. Definitely recommend trying this strain!!! Definitely the strain to get you floating to the kitchen to get something to eat. Great body high and keeps the mind in orbit near the ozone layer close to space. I Love Wedding Cake. Extremely impressed with this strain. Picked it up from the Dispensary and it tests at 29.4%. Amazing taste. High potency. One of my new favorite strains. Me and a few buddies of mine got fucked up on this shit. I wish we had been told how strong it was, because we went at it for a couple hours, and we were high for many more to come. A dozen hits on a piece and that was all it took to keep us good, I even felt it the next. Super strong, but goddamn I had a great time. One of the best strains I\\'ve smoked hands down must try immediately instantly high head high ASAP very potent shout out to the JUNGLE boys!\\nstraight up good quality breeding and cultivating best quality I\\'ve ever had. smoked a raw cone and hardly choked got lost in another room for about an hour and came back and the room still smelled like straight dank! see you guys again soon! I guess because I\\'m vaping a concentrate cartridge that I\\'m not getting what everyone else is getting. It did help get me moving in the mornings. It helped with my nerve pain for only two weeks. THC: 8.20% CBD: 5.00%. Heard a lot about this strain but found it mediocre. Fairly smooth and enough \\nCBD to relax the muscles but that\\'s about it. 10/10 \\nonly down side is £20/1g. \\nOther than that a very good strong weed with a very intense high This Wedding cake smells spicypiney with a hint of floral notes to it and tastes exactly as it smells, upon exhale it also delivers a heavy hit with a hint of some diesel terps to it, flavour stays in the mouth for a while as well. a few hours later you will either be eating too much or falling asleep. pretty great strain when you can/t sleep. I’ve had insomnia for 2 days and this strain knocked me and made me still feel good when I woke up. I can have my cake and smoke it too.  Lion Tree Farms has possibly brought the Emerald Triangle to Oregon. Great bud nice taste good high just be careful this stuff will put you out cold before you know it......lol..... I\\npassed out twice first day I had it and I have a very high tolerance. stopped by TCL and got a 1/4 of the original breeder cut and I must say as a heavy medication user a easy 5 stars. nice firm light green nugs. light smoke with a heavy onset and long lasting with a perfect white ash. This strain & a good book is perfect to end my work week ... I\\'m feeling so relaxed right now, exactly what I needed :) Too fire Loving this one. I picked up a paint brush & starting painting with watercolor. Then I suddenly felt really relaxed, eyelids were heavy so I laid down to listen to music but I could easily drift off to sleep if I wanted to. Pure Bliss! And two of my favorite strains, GSC\\'s & cherry pie. I was soooo stressed out and anxious after work today but now ... it\\'s like it never happened & im in my own little world for the next few hours ;) One of my top strains for sure. Love how flexible you can be with this it will make you feel energetic during the day but isn\\'t racy so you can fall asleep after smoking no problem. Good for ADHD and stress. Smoked a couple bowls and cranked out a 6 page paper in a few hours (a feat that would normally take an all nighter to pull off). This is a phenomenal strain.  I am not too crazy about cookies phenotypes but this one takes the cake.  Pun intended.  Please try this one if you see it.  It definitively tastes like vanilla cake topped with a light almond frosting. Love it!  MMMMmmMMMMmm! Thank you Lion Tree Farms! Light green and lime green covered it crystals which make it look a even lighter green. This bud happy me stoned with the munchies beyond belief. Super smooth smoke with a very pungent skunk aroma. Great for meditation. I really enjoy this strain. It\\'s great if you wanna get stoned but you also have shit to do. No couch-lock here. Absolutely amazing strain. Incredible taste and an elevating, euphoric buzz 5/5 Nose: Lemony doughey meringuey bread soaked in champagne and covered with a thin layer of sugar that\\'s really zestyish\\nFlavor: the name says it all. \\nLook: stupid frosty! \\nThx Jungle Boyz So terpy, love this strain. Just grabbed a quarter of it, smoked a joint of it at work. Increased energy while maintaining a mellow high, such a nice blend of relaxation and productivity. Definitely a good daytime strain Very strong concentrate. \"In the zone\" high with a good body buzz. Strong buzz. Too much makes me a bit anxious. Great flavor. Sticky!!! Purchased some buds from Liontree farms at Oregon Finest. It is very indica dominant, which I prefer. Very relaxing, yet euphoric. Perfect for pain and stress. Got a nice, relaxing couch lock. Hello Fellow Earthlings,\\n\\nI wrote about Wedding Cake a few months ago, but I just got a batch of Cake today from SCSA Dispensary, and its so damned good, it\\'s worth noting, and I don\\'t know about you, but each time I smoke a strain, grown by different breeders, they affect me differently.  The men and women who grew this particular vintage produced truly 5 Star material, it\\'s exceptional in its strength and in its Sativa overtones, by way of its Durban Poison lineage.  One of the smoothest smokes, it is quite sweet on exhale.  It is Super Bowl Sunday, and my son and I just smoked a 1/2 joint approximately 20 minutes ago.  The uplifting sativa influence has been tempered by the Girl Scout Cookies genetics, to make for a very pleasant atmosphere in my brain, from which I shall view the game with my son.  He will be contributing his observations and internal workings, (or something like that), if he has anything that would differentiate from mine.\\nThe buds in this crop are between 1\"-2\" diameter nuggets that are totally covered in white crystalline dust, so much so that I\\'d describe the buds as green/white, with not much of a strong odor, but man, are they visually appealing.\\nThe buds grind up very nicely, with the ground up matter glistening in the lamplight.  It sure rolls up nice too.\\nIt\\'s been about 45 minutes since lightning up that doobie, and we both agree, this is some very fine marijuana.\\nScore this as a 5/5. I took 3 large bong hits about 20 minutes ago.... \\n\\nA+++!!\\n\\nIt\\'s been a very long time since I\\'ve been this high (with a dash of stoned) and it\\'s a fantastic high! \\n\\nI picked this up today while I was looking for a new sativa to try. During the day I like to smoke something that will both keep me alert and mentally clear. So far, now 40 min after bong hits (and this is all I\\'ve written), and I\\'m definitely alert and thoroughly enjoying the hell out of the strain. \\n\\nI wouldn\\'t smoke it during the day though, not because it makes me tired (I\\'m completely wired from it) but because my brain simply doesn\\'t function well enough to work (or do much of anything for that matter).\\n\\nI\\'d recommend starting with 1 or 2 bong hits first and give it about 15 minutes. This is definitely a \"creeper\" high so be careful. \\n\\nSuper fun high balanced with just the right amount of stoned!! I can\\'t say enough about this pot. I\\'d highly recommend it to anyone who wants to be super stoned but not too tired. I\\'m really glad I bought it. It may be my new all time favorite weed.\\n\\nEnjoy! If people wonder where you disappeared to, chances are you were last seen smoking this strain before you eloped with the whole bushel.\\n\\nIn a time when purple isn’t seen as often as I’d like, Wedding Cake’s sparkling, violet accents are a welcome partner to the pipe. The flavor is fragrant, and the smoke is smooth. The lack of hacking doesn’t mean a lack in high; Wedding Cake is going to sweep you off your feet... Or rather, lay you out on the couch.\\n\\nIt’s okay to love a plant… Right?

The wedding cake budder/crumble I got from Reef in queen creek, AZ was amazing. Super relaxed and awake. One of my all time favorites. Has a  smooth, creamy flavor and a potent high. Smells like frosting. Jungle Boyz puts a good spin on GSC, very frosty and super potent. Good taste, best in the evening for pain and muscle relaxer. I used it during the daytime with Strawberry Lemonade and it pairs excellent. Highly recommend splitting and eighth of each strain. One of my favorite strains. Smells like frosting and taste like cream with a hint of cherry. Has a powerful high. It first tastes like lemon, then butter. In the same breath. Sounds strange but it\\'s true. I\\'ve tried it a few times now. It\\'s relaxing but could be okay for daytime in addition to nighttime for most people. Helps pain and anxiety. Tastes like lemon shortbread cookies! So yummy. \\nReally helped calm me down from a manic episode where I woke up at 2:43 and couldn\\'t sleep all night, but it did keep me calmer than without. So much silliness and giggles. Found ourselves dancing to Rick Astley on a bed. Def a new fave. It literally tasted like cake! The smell made me want to taste it when I opened it up lol the smoke itself smells yummy and it\\'s pretty smooth in raw papers. Wow.  These flowers actually smell like a wedding or birthday cake.  Crazy.  The taste is creamy and smooth and the high is powerful and immediate but smooth enough to get things done.  Love it. I have a higher tolerance so I really enjoy this strain. Very potent and leans more towards an indica. Very relaxing feel but can still easily get around cooking/cleaning etc. if you needed. I like to enjoy a good book with a nice tank full of wedding cake shatter oil but auto dabber right by my side. awesome hybrid! deff a indica dominant but not enough to make you sleepy! Very smooth. Very delicate, yet comes with a nice heavy high. It\\'s slow to work, so be careful. I usually find most highs instantaneous, but this took several minutes for it to hit. Euphoric, happy high with a slow fade. Had some near like psychedelic moments but nothing too intense and very short lived. Great a few hours before bed as it really put me to sleep as the high faded. Amazing, hits really smooth! Relaxing but energetic One of my favorite hybrids to smoke real nice bud structure and terrines and thrivhomes galore Pretty relaxinng 7 on potency picked this strain the other day and wow blew my socks off its awesome just the right type of meds, really gave me the giggles and an awesome body high, and made me clean the frig out if you know what i mean.lol 5 ⭐️!! My absolute FAVORITE strain. I don\\'t know what it is about this one that is so perfect for me. The flower is absolutely amazing. The right amount of flavor and diesel goodness. Right now I have some live resin and the flavor holds up fantastic! Better than any shatter or clear, the live resin really holds the flavor profile. I usually only dab a few times a day and smoke flower the rest. With this live resin is so damn good, I don\\'t even want flower. But it is very potent! Both flower and live resin are strong. Love love love! I\\'m in love with wedding cake 🎂❤️ Pretty mellow, gave me giggles and slight anxiety. Woke up with a headache the next day Been looking out for this strain and snagged some just minutes after its arrival. Fast acting, strong, I feel happy and warm and my pain and spasms subsided quickly. A favorite celebration. 😍🎂👍 What is the difference between this strain and pink cookies, and birthday cake kush. Also I have been smoking a lot of captains cake and have been trying to figure out whats the cross is on that cause I think its the same cross as these strains. Any knowledge anybody? Pretty mild, good for pain, makes me a bit sleepy I bought this in a dispensary in Carbondale, CO some time in 2015, though I admit I don\\'t recall which dispensary :( wish I did because they deserve props for stocking this awesome genetic. \\nI remember the nug was very beautiful to look at, but the main feature was its SCENT and FLAVOR. Memories of a sugary sweet white frosting, maybe with those multicolored confetti. What more can I say than that.  \\nVery potent head and body high and very long lasting. \\n(BTW - This strain has already been created, under \"Birthday Cake Kush\" (same thing, just an alias), but I am glad to see it again because it needs to be brought into the forefront.) For when cookies and of are both needed this strain is a treasure for sure ! I had pink cookies OMG if u love cookie this is a must have.  flavor so terpy and intense... Smoked some flower from a dispensary that labeled this hybrid strain as \"San Diego Girl Scout Cookies.\" Super potent. Beware. Such a frosty strain heavy dense buds with a cookie structure favorite to roll in woods The bud is tasty,hits fast and\\n last a couple hours a must for taste and aroma Hits haaaaaard. Take it easy on this one. Straight couch lock. A little goes a long way with this strain lol I smoked a joint and I\\'m still a little high and it\\'s been like 7 hours.. Maybe I should stick to smoking a quarter of a joint at a time. Quite possibly perfect, smell before and after smoke amazing, the high is a well balanced buzz great for anything love this strain we get it everytime we see it this is funfetti originally bred by bay exclusives weedingcakes boof fetti '"
