==============================

A Set of Cannabis Data Solutions
1. A Leafly API
2. A Dashboard for Review Sentiments Across Lineage and Dispos
3. New Strain Terpene Predictor and Name Generator
4. Dispo's Team lineup Strain recommender


## Data Analyst Goals
- Build a dashboard for understand
  - Strain Lineage
  - Rating Sentiment
  - Terpene Distributions
  - Combinations of the above
- Testing Hypothesis
  - Lineage Impact on Dispo Overall Sentiment
  - Lineage and terpene impact

## Data Science Goals
- Predict strains terp profile and name generator
- Cluster Strains and Dispos using reviews

## Data Engineering Goals
- Build an automated pipeline that pulls data from an API endpoint
  - Schedule pulls from leafly into a cleaning pipeline
  - Create an endpoint to query from based on dispo, strain, lineage, reviews
